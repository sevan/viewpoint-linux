On first boot you'll need to perform the following to get networking
started and ssh'd in.
run systemd-machine-id-setup to create /etc/machine-id
run ssh-keygen -A to create key pairs for use by sshd
create a user to ssh in with using useradd -m someusername
set a password using passwd someusername
enable sshd to start automatically using systemctl enable sshd
Reboot
Trim /etc/motd
