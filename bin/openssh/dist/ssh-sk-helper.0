SSH-SK-HELPER(8)            System Manager's Manual           SSH-SK-HELPER(8)

NAME
     ssh-sk-helper M-bM-^@M-^S OpenSSH helper for FIDO authenticator support

SYNOPSIS
     ssh-sk-helper [-v]

DESCRIPTION
     ssh-sk-helper is used by ssh-agent(1) to access keys provided by a FIDO
     authenticator.

     ssh-sk-helper is not intended to be invoked by the user, but from
     ssh-agent(1).

     A single option is supported:

     -v      Verbose mode.  Causes ssh-sk-helper to print debugging messages
             about its progress.  This is helpful in debugging problems.
             Multiple -v options increase the verbosity.  The maximum is 3.

             Note that ssh-agent(1) will automatically pass the -v flag to
             ssh-sk-helper when it has itself been placed in debug mode.

SEE ALSO
     ssh(1), ssh-add(1), ssh-agent(1)

HISTORY
     ssh-sk-helper first appeared in OpenBSD 6.7.
