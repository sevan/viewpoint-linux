# Compose sequences
# This part is from sunt5-us-cz.map file created by Jakub Jelinek.
# This should work for latin1 and latin2,
# unfortunately some keys compose sequences had to be modified
# a little bit, so that both latin1 and latin2 can be shared,
# particularly " something has been replaced by : something
# in latin1 composes.
