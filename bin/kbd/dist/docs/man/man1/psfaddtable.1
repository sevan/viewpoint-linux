.SH NAME
psfaddtable \- add a Unicode character table to a console font
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B psfaddtable
.I fontfile tablefile outfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX "psfaddtable command" "" "\fLpsfaddtable\fR command"  
.LP
.B psfaddtable
takes a console font in .psf format given by
.I fontfile
and merges it with the Unicode character table given by
.I tablefile
to produce a font file with an embedded character table, which is
written to
.IR outfile .
An input file name of "\-" denotes standard input,
and an output file name of "\-" denotes standard output.
If the
.I fontfile
already contains an embedded character table, it is ignored.
.SH TABLE FILE FORMAT
Each line in the
.I tablefile
should be either blank, contain a comment (preceded by
.IR # ),
or contain a sequence of numbers in either decimal (default), octal
(preceded by
.IR 0 ),
or hexadecimal (preceded by
.IR 0x )
format, separated by spaces or tabs.
The first number on each line indicates the glyph slot in the
font that is being referred to, this is between 0 and 0xff for a
256-character font and 0 and 0x1ff for a 512-character font.  Any
subsequent numbers on the same line are Unicodes matched by this
specific glyph slot.  Instead of a single Unicode one may have
a sequence of Unicodes separates by commas, to denote that the
glyph depicts the corresponding composed symbol.
It is permissible to have multiple lines for the same glyph.
