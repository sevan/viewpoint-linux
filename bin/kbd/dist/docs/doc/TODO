- selection can now cut & paste 8-bit chars, but not yet Unicode
- compose does not work together with Unicode
  (struct kbdiacr has three chars: base + diacr -> result,
   but the result should be a string)
- strings produced by a function key cannot contain \000;
  many other places this char is excluded
- current status (translation table, Unicode output) can be set,
  but not read out from the kernel; thus, showconsolefont changes the
  status, but cannot restore it
