.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Configuration files in the
environment\&.d/
directories contain lists of environment variable assignments for services started by the systemd user instance\&.
\fBsystemd-environment-d-generator\fR(8)
parses them and updates the environment exported by the systemd user instance\&. See below for an discussion of which processes inherit those variables\&.
.PP
It is recommended to use numerical prefixes for file names to simplify ordering\&.
.PP
For backwards compatibility, a symlink to
/etc/environment
is installed, so this file is also parsed\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE"
.PP
Configuration files are read from directories in
/etc/,
/run/,
/usr/local/lib/, and
/usr/lib/, in order of precedence, as listed in the SYNOPSIS section above\&. Files must have the
"\&.conf"
extension\&. Files in
/etc/
override files with the same name in
/run/,
/usr/local/lib/, and
/usr/lib/\&. Files in
/run/
override files with the same name under
/usr/\&.
.PP
All configuration files are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of which of the directories they reside in\&. If multiple files specify the same option, the entry in the file with the lexicographically latest name will take precedence\&. Thus, the configuration in a certain file may either be replaced completely (by placing a file with the same name in a directory with higher priority), or individual settings might be changed (by specifying additional settings in a file with a different name that is ordered later)\&.
.PP
Packages should install their configuration files in
/usr/lib/
(distribution packages) or
/usr/local/lib/
(local installs)\&. Files in
/etc/
are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration files installed by vendor packages\&. It is recommended to prefix all filenames with a two\-digit number and a dash, to simplify the ordering of the files\&.
.PP
If the administrator wants to disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to
/dev/null
in the configuration directory in
/etc/, with the same filename as the vendor configuration file\&. If the vendor configuration file is included in the initrd image, the image has to be regenerated\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION FORMAT"
.PP
The configuration files contain a list of
"\fIKEY\fR=\fIVALUE\fR"
environment variable assignments, separated by newlines\&. The right hand side of these assignments may reference previously defined environment variables, using the
"${OTHER_KEY}"
and
"$OTHER_KEY"
format\&. It is also possible to use
"${\fIFOO\fR:\-\fIDEFAULT_VALUE\fR}"
to expand in the same way as
"${\fIFOO\fR}"
unless the expansion would be empty, in which case it expands to
\fIDEFAULT_VALUE\fR, and use
"${\fIFOO\fR:+\fIALTERNATE_VALUE\fR}"
to expand to
\fIALTERNATE_VALUE\fR
as long as
"${\fIFOO\fR}"
would have expanded to a non\-empty value\&. No other elements of shell syntax are supported\&.
.PP
Each
\fIKEY\fR
must be a valid variable name\&. Empty lines and lines beginning with the comment character
"#"
are ignored\&.

.SH "APPLICABILITY"
.PP
Environment variables exported by the user manager (\fBsystemd \-\-user\fR
instance started in the
user@\fIuid\fR\&.service
system service) apply to any services started by that manager\&. In particular, this may include services which run user shells\&. For example in the GNOME environment, the graphical terminal emulator runs as the
gnome\-terminal\-server\&.service
user unit, which in turn runs the user shell, so that shell will inherit environment variables exported by the user manager\&. For other instances of the shell, not launched by the user manager, the environment they inherit is defined by the program that starts them\&. Hint: in general,
\fBsystemd.service\fR(5)
units contain programs launched by systemd, and
\fBsystemd.scope\fR(5)
units contain programs launched by something else\&.
.PP
Specifically, for ssh logins, the
\fBsshd\fR(8)
service builds an environment that is a combination of variables forwarded from the remote system and defined by
\fBsshd\fR, see the discussion in
\fBssh\fR(1)\&. A graphical display session will have an analogous mechanism to define the environment\&. Note that some managers query the systemd user instance for the exported environment and inject this configuration into programs they start, using
\fBsystemctl show\-environment\fR
or the underlying D\-Bus call\&.
