\fImount\fR\&.mount,
\fIswap\fR\&.swap
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Unit configuration files for services, sockets, mount points, and swap devices share a subset of configuration options which define the execution environment of spawned processes\&.
.PP
This man page lists the configuration options shared by these four unit types\&. See
\fBsystemd.unit\fR(5)
for the common options of all unit configuration files, and
\fBsystemd.service\fR(5),
\fBsystemd.socket\fR(5),
\fBsystemd.swap\fR(5), and
\fBsystemd.mount\fR(5)
for more information on the specific unit configuration files\&. The execution specific configuration options are configured in the [Service], [Socket], [Mount], or [Swap] sections, depending on the unit type\&.
.PP
In addition, options which control resources through Linux Control Groups (cgroups) are listed in
\fBsystemd.resource-control\fR(5)\&. Those options complement options listed here\&.
.SH "IMPLICIT DEPENDENCIES"

path component\&.
.PP
\fIWorkingDirectory=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a directory path relative to the service\*(Aqs root directory specified by
\fIRootDirectory=\fR, or the special value
"~"\&. Sets the working directory for executed processes\&. If set to
"~", the home directory of the user specified in
\fIUser=\fR

\fIRootDirectory=\fR/\fIRootImage=\fR

.RE
.PP
\fIRootDirectory=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a directory path relative to the host\*(Aqs root directory (i\&.e\&. the root of the system running the service manager)\&. Sets the root directory for executed processes, with the
\fBchroot\fR(2)
system call\&. If this is used, it must be ensured that the process binary and all its auxiliary files are available in the

\fIRootImage=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a path to a block device node or regular file as argument\&. This call is similar to
\fIRootDirectory=\fR
however mounts a file system hierarchy from a block device node or loopback file instead of a directory\&. The device node or file system image file needs to contain a file system without a partition table, or a file system within an MBR/MS\-DOS or GPT partition table with only a single Linux\-compatible partition, or a set of file systems within a GPT partition table that follows the

\fIRootImageOptions=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a comma\-separated list of mount options that will be used on disk images specified by
\fIRootImage=\fR\&. Optionally a partition name can be prefixed, followed by colon, in case the image has multiple partitions, otherwise partition name
"root"
is implied\&. Options for multiple partitions can be specified in a single line with space separators\&. Assigning an empty string removes previous assignments\&. Duplicated options are ignored\&. For a list of valid mount options, please refer to

.RE
.PP
\fIRootHash=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a data integrity (dm\-verity) root hash specified in hexadecimal, or the path to a file containing a root hash in ASCII hexadecimal format\&. This option enables data integrity checks using dm\-verity, if the used image contains the appropriate integrity data (see above) or if
\fIRootVerity=\fR
is used\&. The specified hash must match the root hash of integrity data, and is usually at least 256 bits (and hence 64 formatted hexadecimal characters) long (in case of SHA256 for example)\&. If this option is not specified, but the image file carries the
"user\&.verity\&.roothash"
extended file attribute (see
\fBxattr\fR(7)), then the root hash is read from it, also as formatted hexadecimal characters\&. If the extended file attribute is not found (or is not supported by the underlying file system), but a file with the
\&.roothash
suffix is found next to the image file, bearing otherwise the same name (except if the image has the
\&.raw
suffix, in which case the root hash file must not have it in its name), the root hash is read from it and automatically used, also as formatted hexadecimal characters\&.
.sp
If the disk image contains a separate
/usr/
partition it may also be Verity protected, in which case the root hash may configured via an extended attribute
"user\&.verity\&.usrhash"
or a
\&.usrhash
file adjacent to the disk image\&. There\*(Aqs currently no option to configure the root hash for the
/usr/
file system via the unit file directly\&.
.sp
This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per\-user instances of the service manager\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIRootHashSignature=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a PKCS7 signature of the
\fIRootHash=\fR
option as a path to a DER\-encoded signature file, or as an ASCII base64 string encoding of a DER\-encoded signature prefixed by
"base64:"\&. The dm\-verity volume will only be opened if the signature of the root hash is valid and signed by a public key present in the kernel keyring\&. If this option is not specified, but a file with the
\&.roothash\&.p7s
suffix is found next to the image file, bearing otherwise the same name (except if the image has the
\&.raw
suffix, in which case the signature file must not have it in its name), the signature is read from it and automatically used\&.
.sp
If the disk image contains a separate
/usr/
partition it may also be Verity protected, in which case the signature for the root hash may configured via a
\&.usrhash\&.p7s
file adjacent to the disk image\&. There\*(Aqs currently no option to configure the root hash signature for the
/usr/

This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per\-user instances of the service manager\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIRootVerity=\fR
.RS 4
Takes the path to a data integrity (dm\-verity) file\&. This option enables data integrity checks using dm\-verity, if
\fIRootImage=\fR
is used and a root\-hash is passed and if the used image itself does not contains the integrity data\&. The integrity data must be matched by the root hash\&. If this option is not specified, but a file with the
\&.verity
suffix is found next to the image file, bearing otherwise the same name (except if the image has the
\&.raw
suffix, in which case the verity data file must not have it in its name), the verity data is read from it and automatically used\&.
.sp
This option is supported only for disk images that contain a single file system, without an enveloping partition table\&. Images that contain a GPT partition table should instead include both root file system and matching Verity data in the same image, implementing the
\m[blue]\fBDiscoverable Partition Specification\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2\&.
.sp
This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per\-user instances of the service manager\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIMountAPIVFS=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean argument\&. If on, a private mount namespace for the unit\*(Aqs processes is created and the API file systems
/proc/,
/sys/,
/dev/
and
/run/
(as an empty
"tmpfs") are mounted inside of it, unless they are already mounted\&. Note that this option has no effect unless used in conjunction with
\fIRootDirectory=\fR/\fIRootImage=\fR
as these four mounts are generally mounted in the host anyway, and unless the root directory is changed, the private mount namespace will be a 1:1 copy of the host\*(Aqs, and include these four mounts\&. Note that the
/dev/
file system of the host is bind mounted if this option is used without
\fIPrivateDevices=\fR\&. To run the service with a private, minimal version of
/dev/, combine this option with
\fIPrivateDevices=\fR\&.
.sp
In order to allow propagating mounts at runtime in a safe manner,
/run/systemd/propagate
on the host will be used to set up new mounts, and
/run/host/incoming/
in the private namespace will be used as an intermediate step to store them before being moved to the final mount point\&.
.sp
This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per\-user instances of the service manager\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIProtectProc=\fR
.RS 4
Takes one of
"noaccess",
"invisible",
"ptraceable"
or
"default"
(which it defaults to)\&. When set, this controls the
"hidepid="
mount option of the
"procfs"
instance for the unit that controls which directories with process metainformation (/proc/\fIPID\fR) are visible and accessible: when set to
"noaccess"
the ability to access most of other users\*(Aq process metadata in
/proc/
is taken away for processes of the service\&. When set to
"invisible"
processes owned by other users are hidden from
/proc/\&. If
"ptraceable"
all processes that cannot be
\fBptrace()\fR\*(Aqed by a process are hidden to it\&. If
"default"
no restrictions on
/proc/
access or visibility are made\&. For further details see
\m[blue]\fBThe /proc Filesystem\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2\&. It is generally recommended to run most system services with this option set to
"invisible"\&. This option is implemented via file system namespacing, and thus cannot be used with services that shall be able to install mount points in the host file system hierarchy\&. Note that the root user is unaffected by this option, so to be effective it has to be used together with
\fIUser=\fR
or
\fIDynamicUser=yes\fR, and also without the
"CAP_SYS_PTRACE"
capability, which also allows a process to bypass this feature\&. It cannot be used for services that need to access metainformation about other users\*(Aq processes\&. This option implies
\fIMountAPIVFS=\fR\&.
.sp
If the kernel doesn\*(Aqt support per\-mount point
\fBhidepid=\fR
mount options this setting remains without effect, and the unit\*(Aqs processes will be able to access and see other process as if the option was not used\&.
.sp
This option is only available for system services and is not supported for services running in per\-user instances of the service manager\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIProcSubset=\fR
.RS 4
Takes one of
"all"
(the default) and
"pid"\&. If
"pid", all files and directories not directly associated with process management and introspection are made invisible in the
/proc/
file system configured for the unit\*(Aqs processes\&. This controls the
"subset="
mount option of the
"procfs"
instance for the unit\&. For further details see
\m[blue]\fBThe /proc Filesystem\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2\&. Note that Linux exposes various kernel APIs via
/proc/, which are made unavailable with this setting\&. Since these APIs are used frequently this option is useful only in a few, specific cases, and is not suitable for most non\-trivial programs\&.
.sp
Much like
\fIProtectProc=\fR
above, this is implemented via file system mount namespacing, and hence the same restrictions apply: it is only available to system services, it disables mount propagation to the host mount table, and it implies
\fIMountAPIVFS=\fR\&. Also, like
\fIProtectProc=\fR
this setting is gracefully disabled if the used kernel does not support the
"subset="
mount option of
"procfs"\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIBindPaths=\fR, \fIBindReadOnlyPaths=\fR
.RS 4
Configures unit\-specific bind mounts\&. A bind mount makes a particular file or directory available at an additional place in the unit\*(Aqs view of the file system\&. Any bind mounts created with this option are specific to the unit, and are not visible in the host\*(Aqs mount table\&. This option expects a whitespace separated list of bind mount definitions\&. Each definition consists of a colon\-separated triple of source path, destination path and option string, where the latter two are optional\&. If only a source path is specified the source and destination is taken to be the same\&. The option string may be either
"rbind"
or
"norbind"
for configuring a recursive or non\-recursive bind mount\&. If the destination path is omitted, the option string must be omitted too\&. Each bind mount definition may be prefixed with
"\-", in which case it will be ignored when its source path does not exist\&.
.sp
\fIBindPaths=\fR
creates regular writable bind mounts (unless the source file system mount is already marked read\-only), while
\fIBindReadOnlyPaths=\fR
creates read\-only bind mounts\&. These settings may be used more than once, each usage appends to the unit\*(Aqs list of bind mounts\&. If the empty string is assigned to either of these two options the entire list of bind mounts defined prior to this is reset\&. Note that in this case both read\-only and regular bind mounts are reset, regardless which of the two settings is used\&.
.sp
This option is particularly useful when
\fIRootDirectory=\fR/\fIRootImage=\fR
is used\&. In this case the source path refers to a path on the host file system, while the destination path refers to a path below the root directory of the unit\&.
.sp
Note that the destination directory must exist or systemd must be able to create it\&. Thus, it is not possible to use those options for mount points nested underneath paths specified in
\fIInaccessiblePaths=\fR, or under

Care should be taken that any processes running as part of a unit for which dynamic users/groups are enabled do not leave files or directories owned by these users/groups around, as a different unit might get the same UID/GID assigned later on, and thus gain access to these files or directories\&. If
\fIDynamicUser=\fR
is enabled,
\fIRemoveIPC=\fR
and
\fIPrivateTmp=\fR
are implied (and cannot be turned off)\&. This ensures that the lifetime of IPC objects and temporary files created by the executed processes is bound to the runtime of the service, and hence the lifetime of the dynamic user/group\&. Since
/tmp/
and
/var/tmp/
are usually the only world\-writable directories on a system this ensures that a unit making use of dynamic user/group allocation cannot leave files around after unit termination\&. Furthermore
\fINoNewPrivileges=\fR
and
\fIRestrictSUIDSGID=\fR
are implicitly enabled (and cannot be disabled), to ensure that processes invoked cannot take benefit or create SUID/SGID files or directories\&. Moreover
\fIProtectSystem=strict\fR
and
\fIProtectHome=read\-only\fR
are implied, thus prohibiting the service to write to arbitrary file system locations\&. In order to allow the service to write to certain directories, they have to be allow\-listed using
\fIReadWritePaths=\fR, but care must be taken so that UID/GID recycling doesn\*(Aqt create security issues involving files created by the service\&. Use
\fIRuntimeDirectory=\fR
(see below) in order to assign a writable runtime directory to a service, owned by the dynamic user/group and removed automatically when the unit is terminated\&. Use
\fIStateDirectory=\fR,
\fICacheDirectory=\fR
and
\fILogsDirectory=\fR
in order to assign a set of writable directories for specific purposes to the service in a way that they are protected from vulnerabilities due to UID reuse (see below)\&. If this option is enabled, care should be taken that the unit\*(Aqs processes do not get access to directories outside of these explicitly configured and managed ones\&. Specifically, do not use
\fIBindPaths=\fR
and be careful with
\fBAF_UNIX\fR
file descriptor passing for directory file descriptors, as this would permit processes to create files or directories owned by the dynamic user/group that are not subject to the lifecycle and access guarantees of the service\&. Defaults to off\&.

.sp
Note that for each unit making use of this option a PAM session handler process will be maintained as part of the unit and stays around as long as the unit is active, to ensure that appropriate actions can be taken when the unit and hence the PAM session terminates\&. This process is named
"(sd\-pam)"
and is an immediate child process of the unit\*(Aqs main process\&.
.sp
Note that when this option is used for a unit it is very likely (depending on PAM configuration) that the main unit process will be migrated to its own session scope unit when it is activated\&. This process will hence be associated with two units: the unit it was originally started from (and for which
\fIPAMName=\fR
was configured), and the session scope unit\&. Any child processes of that process will however be associated with the session scope unit only\&. This has implications when used in combination with
\fINotifyAccess=\fR\fBall\fR, as these child processes will not be able to affect changes in the original unit through notification messages\&. These messages will be considered belonging to the session scope unit and not the original unit\&. It is hence not recommended to use

Set soft and hard limits on various resources for executed processes\&. See
\fBsetrlimit\fR(2)
for details on the resource limit concept\&. Resource limits may be specified in two formats: either as single value to set a specific soft and hard limit to the same value, or as colon\-separated pair
\fBsoft:hard\fR
to set both limits individually (e\&.g\&.
"LimitAS=4G:16G")\&. Use the string
\fBinfinity\fR
to configure no limit on a specific resource\&. The multiplicative suffixes K, M, G, T, P and E (to the base 1024) may be used for resource limits measured in bytes (e\&.g\&.
"LimitAS=16G")\&. For the limits referring to time values, the usual time units ms, s, min, h and so on may be used (see
\fBsystemd.time\fR(7)
for details)\&. Note that if no time unit is specified for
\fILimitCPU=\fR
the default unit of seconds is implied, while for
\fILimitRTTIME=\fR
the default unit of microseconds is implied\&. Also, note that the effective granularity of the limits might influence their enforcement\&. For example, time limits specified for
\fILimitCPU=\fR
will be rounded up implicitly to multiples of 1s\&. For
\fILimitNICE=\fR
the value may be specified in two syntaxes: if prefixed with
"+"
or
"\-", the value is understood as regular Linux nice value in the range \-20\&...19\&. If not prefixed like this the value is understood as raw resource limit parameter in the range 0\&...40 (with 0 being equivalent to 1)\&.
.sp
Note that most process resource limits configured with these options are per\-process, and processes may fork in order to acquire a new set of resources that are accounted independently of the original process, and may thus escape limits set\&. Also note that
\fILimitRSS=\fR
is not implemented on Linux, and setting it has no effect\&. Often it is advisable to prefer the resource controls listed in
\fBsystemd.resource-control\fR(5)
over these per\-process limits, as they apply to services as a whole, may be altered dynamically at runtime, and are generally more expressive\&. For example,
\fIMemoryMax=\fR
is a more powerful (and working) replacement for
\fILimitRSS=\fR\&.
.sp
Resource limits not configured explicitly for a unit default to the value configured in the various
\fIDefaultLimitCPU=\fR,
\fIDefaultLimitFSIZE=\fR, \&... options available in
\fBsystemd-system.conf\fR(5), and \(en if not configured there \(en the kernel or per\-user defaults, as defined by the OS (the latter only for user services, see below)\&.
.sp
For system units these resource limits may be chosen freely\&. When these settings are configured in a user service (i\&.e\&. a service run by the per\-user instance of the service manager) they cannot be used to raise the limits above those set for the user manager itself when it was first invoked, as the user\*(Aqs service manager generally lacks the privileges to do so\&. In user context these configuration options are hence only useful to lower the limits passed in or to raise the soft limit to the maximum of the hard limit as configured for the user\&. To raise the user\*(Aqs limits further, the available configuration mechanisms differ between operating systems, but typically require privileges\&. In most cases it is possible to configure higher per\-user resource limits via PAM or by setting limits on the system service encapsulating the user\*(Aqs service manager, i\&.e\&. the user\*(Aqs instance of
user@\&.service\&. After making such changes, make sure to restart the user\*(Aqs service manager\&.

The following sandboxing options are an effective way to limit the exposure of the system towards the unit\*(Aqs processes\&. It is recommended to turn on as many of these options for each unit as is possible without negatively affecting the process\*(Aq ability to operate\&. Note that many of these sandboxing features are gracefully turned off on systems where the underlying security mechanism is not available\&. For example,
\fIProtectSystem=\fR
has no effect if the kernel is built without file system namespacing or if the service manager runs in a container manager that makes file system namespacing unavailable to its payload\&. Similar,
\fIRestrictRealtime=\fR
has no effect on systems that lack support for SECCOMP system call filtering, or in containers where support for this is turned off\&.
.PP
Also note that some sandboxing functionality is generally not available in user services (i\&.e\&. services run by the per\-user service manager)\&. Specifically, the various settings requiring file system namespacing support (such as
\fIProtectSystem=\fR) are not available, as the underlying kernel functionality is only accessible to privileged processes\&. However, most namespacing settings, that will not work on their own in user services, will work when used in conjunction with
\fIPrivateUsers=\fR\fBtrue\fR\&.
.PP
\fIProtectSystem=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean argument or the special values
"full"
or
"strict"\&. If true, mounts the
/usr/
and the boot loader directories (/boot
and
/efi) read\-only for processes invoked by this unit\&. If set to
"full", the
/etc/
directory is mounted read\-only, too\&. If set to
"strict"
the entire file system hierarchy is mounted read\-only, except for the API file system subtrees
/dev/,
/proc/
and
/sys/
(protect these directories using
\fIPrivateDevices=\fR,
\fIProtectKernelTunables=\fR,
\fIProtectControlGroups=\fR)\&. This setting ensures that any modification of the vendor\-supplied operating system (and optionally its configuration, and local mounts) is prohibited for the service\&. It is recommended to enable this setting for all long\-running services, unless they are involved with system updates or need to modify the operating system in other ways\&. If this option is used,
\fIReadWritePaths=\fR
may be used to exclude specific directories from being made read\-only\&. This setting is implied if
\fIDynamicUser=\fR
is set\&. This setting cannot ensure protection in all cases\&. In general it has the same limitations as
\fIReadOnlyPaths=\fR, see below\&. Defaults to off\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIProtectHome=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean argument or the special values
"read\-only"
or
"tmpfs"\&. If true, the directories
/home/,
/root, and
/run/user
are made inaccessible and empty for processes invoked by this unit\&. If set to
"read\-only", the three directories are made read\-only instead\&. If set to
"tmpfs", temporary file systems are mounted on the three directories in read\-only mode\&. The value
"tmpfs"
is useful to hide home directories not relevant to the processes invoked by the unit, while still allowing necessary directories to be made visible when listed in
\fIBindPaths=\fR
or
\fIBindReadOnlyPaths=\fR\&.
.sp
Setting this to
"yes"
is mostly equivalent to set the three directories in
\fIInaccessiblePaths=\fR\&. Similarly,
"read\-only"
is mostly equivalent to
\fIReadOnlyPaths=\fR, and
"tmpfs"
is mostly equivalent to
\fITemporaryFileSystem=\fR
with
":ro"\&.
.sp
It is recommended to enable this setting for all long\-running services (in particular network\-facing ones), to ensure they cannot get access to private user data, unless the services actually require access to the user\*(Aqs private data\&. This setting is implied if
\fIDynamicUser=\fR
is set\&. This setting cannot ensure protection in all cases\&. In general it has the same limitations as
\fIReadOnlyPaths=\fR, see below\&.

In case of
\fIRuntimeDirectory=\fR
the innermost subdirectories are removed when the unit is stopped\&. It is possible to preserve the specified directories in this case if
\fIRuntimeDirectoryPreserve=\fR
is configured to
\fBrestart\fR
or
\fByes\fR
(see below)\&. The directories specified with
\fIStateDirectory=\fR,
\fICacheDirectory=\fR,
\fILogsDirectory=\fR,
\fIConfigurationDirectory=\fR
are not removed when the unit is stopped\&.
.sp
Except in case of
\fIConfigurationDirectory=\fR, the innermost specified directories will be owned by the user and group specified in
\fIUser=\fR
and
\fIGroup=\fR\&. If the specified directories already exist and their owning user or group do not match the configured ones, all files and directories below the specified directories as well as the directories themselves will have their file ownership recursively changed to match what is configured\&. As an optimization, if the specified directories are already owned by the right user and group, files and directories below of them are left as\-is, even if they do not match what is requested\&. The innermost specified directories will have their access mode adjusted to the what is specified in
\fIRuntimeDirectoryMode=\fR,
\fIStateDirectoryMode=\fR,
\fICacheDirectoryMode=\fR,
\fILogsDirectoryMode=\fR
and
\fIConfigurationDirectoryMode=\fR\&.
.sp
These options imply
\fIBindPaths=\fR
for the specified paths\&. When combined with
\fIRootDirectory=\fR
or
\fIRootImage=\fR
these paths always reside on the host and are mounted from there into the unit\*(Aqs file system namespace\&.
.sp
If
\fIDynamicUser=\fR
is used in conjunction with
\fIStateDirectory=\fR, the logic for
\fICacheDirectory=\fR
and
\fILogsDirectory=\fR
is slightly altered: the directories are created below
/var/lib/private,
/var/cache/private
and
/var/log/private, respectively, which are host directories made inaccessible to unprivileged users, which ensures that access to these directories cannot be gained through dynamic user ID recycling\&. Symbolic links are created to hide this difference in behaviour\&. Both from perspective of the host and from inside the unit, the relevant directories hence always appear directly below
/var/lib,
/var/cache
and
/var/log\&.
.sp
Use
\fIRuntimeDirectory=\fR
to manage one or more runtime directories for the unit and bind their lifetime to the daemon runtime\&. This is particularly useful for unprivileged daemons that cannot create runtime directories in
/run/
due to lack of privileges, and to make sure the runtime directory is cleaned up automatically after use\&. For runtime directories that require more complex or different configuration or lifetime guarantees, please consider using
\fBtmpfiles.d\fR(5)\&.
.sp
The directories defined by these options are always created under the standard paths used by systemd (/var/,
/run/,
/etc/, \&...)\&. If the service needs directories in a different location, a different mechanism has to be used to create them\&.
.sp
\fBtmpfiles.d\fR(5)
provides functionality that overlaps with these options\&. Using these options is recommended, because the lifetime of the directories is tied directly to the lifetime of the unit, and it is not necessary to ensure that the
tmpfiles\&.d
configuration is executed before the unit is started\&.
.sp
To remove any of the directories created by these settings, use the
\fBsystemctl clean \&...\fR
command on the relevant units, see
\fBsystemctl\fR(1)
for details\&.
.sp
Example: if a system service unit has the following,
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
RuntimeDirectory=foo/bar baz
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
the service manager creates
/run/foo
(if it does not exist),
/run/foo/bar, and
/run/baz\&. The directories
/run/foo/bar
and
/run/baz
except
/run/foo
are owned by the user and group specified in
\fIUser=\fR
and
\fIGroup=\fR, and removed when the service is stopped\&.
.sp
Example: if a system service unit has the following,
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
RuntimeDirectory=foo/bar
StateDirectory=aaa/bbb ccc
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
then the environment variable
"RUNTIME_DIRECTORY"
is set with
"/run/foo/bar", and
"STATE_DIRECTORY"
is set with
"/var/lib/aaa/bbb:/var/lib/ccc"\&.

\fIRuntimeDirectoryPreserve=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean argument or

\fBno\fR
(the default), the directories specified in
\fIRuntimeDirectory=\fR
are always removed when the service stops\&. If set to
\fBrestart\fR
the directories are preserved when the service is both automatically and manually restarted\&. Here, the automatic restart means the operation specified in
\fIRestart=\fR, and manual restart means the one triggered by
\fBsystemctl restart foo\&.service\fR\&. If set to
\fByes\fR, then the directories are not removed when the service is stopped\&. Note that since the runtime directory
/run/
is a mount point of
"tmpfs", then for system services the directories specified in
\fIRuntimeDirectory=\fR
are removed when the system is rebooted\&.

\fIReadWritePaths=\fR, \fIReadOnlyPaths=\fR, \fIInaccessiblePaths=\fR, \fIExecPaths=\fR, \fINoExecPaths=\fR
.RS 4
Sets up a new file system namespace for executed processes\&. These options may be used to limit access a process has to the file system\&. Each setting takes a space\-separated list of paths relative to the host\*(Aqs root directory (i\&.e\&. the system running the service manager)\&. Note that if paths contain symlinks, they are resolved relative to the root directory set with
\fIRootDirectory=\fR/\fIRootImage=\fR\&.
.sp
Paths listed in
\fIReadWritePaths=\fR
are accessible from within the namespace with the same access modes as from outside of it\&. Paths listed in
\fIReadOnlyPaths=\fR
are accessible for reading only, writing will be refused even if the usual file access controls would permit this\&. Nest
\fIReadWritePaths=\fR
inside of
\fIReadOnlyPaths=\fR
in order to provide writable subdirectories within read\-only directories\&. Use
\fIReadWritePaths=\fR
in order to allow\-list specific paths for write access if
\fIProtectSystem=strict\fR
is used\&.
.sp
Paths listed in
\fIInaccessiblePaths=\fR
will be made inaccessible for processes inside the namespace along with everything below them in the file system hierarchy\&. This may be more restrictive than desired, because it is not possible to nest
\fIReadWritePaths=\fR,
\fIReadOnlyPaths=\fR,
\fIBindPaths=\fR, or
\fIBindReadOnlyPaths=\fR
inside it\&. For a more flexible option, see
\fITemporaryFileSystem=\fR\&.
.sp
Content in paths listed in
\fINoExecPaths=\fR
are not executable even if the usual file access controls would permit this\&. Nest
\fIExecPaths=\fR
inside of
\fINoExecPaths=\fR
in order to provide executable content within non\-executable directories\&.
.sp
Non\-directory paths may be specified as well\&. These options may be specified more than once, in which case all paths listed will have limited access from within the namespace\&. If the empty string is assigned to this option, the specific list is reset, and all prior assignments have no effect\&.
.sp
Paths in
\fIReadWritePaths=\fR,
\fIReadOnlyPaths=\fR,
\fIInaccessiblePaths=\fR,
\fIExecPaths=\fR
and
\fINoExecPaths=\fR
may be prefixed with
"\-", in which case they will be ignored when they do not exist\&. If prefixed with
"+"
the paths are taken relative to the root directory of the unit, as configured with
\fIRootDirectory=\fR/\fIRootImage=\fR, instead of relative to the root directory of the host (see above)\&. When combining
"\-"
and
"+"
on the same path make sure to specify
"\-"
first, and
"+"
second\&.
.sp
Note that these settings will disconnect propagation of mounts from the unit\*(Aqs processes to the host\&. This means that this setting may not be used for services which shall be able to install mount points in the main mount namespace\&. For
\fIReadWritePaths=\fR
and
\fIReadOnlyPaths=\fR
propagation in the other direction is not affected, i\&.e\&. mounts created on the host generally appear in the unit processes\*(Aq namespace, and mounts removed on the host also disappear there too\&. In particular, note that mount propagation from host to unit will result in unmodified mounts to be created in the unit\*(Aqs namespace, i\&.e\&. writable mounts appearing on the host will be writable in the unit\*(Aqs namespace too, even when propagated below a path marked with
\fIReadOnlyPaths=\fR! Restricting access with these options hence does not extend to submounts of a directory that are created later on\&. This means the lock\-down offered by that setting is not complete, and does not offer full protection\&.
.sp
Note that the effect of these settings may be undone by privileged processes\&. In order to set up an effective sandboxed environment for a unit it is thus recommended to combine these settings with either
\fICapabilityBoundingSet=~CAP_SYS_ADMIN\fR
or
\fISystemCallFilter=~@mount\fR\&.

Takes a space\-separated list of mount points for temporary file systems (tmpfs)\&. If set, a new file system namespace is set up for executed processes, and a temporary file system is mounted on each mount point\&. This option may be specified more than once, in which case temporary file systems are mounted on all listed mount points\&. If the empty string is assigned to this option, the list is reset, and all prior assignments have no effect\&. Each mount point may optionally be suffixed with a colon (":") and mount options such as
"size=10%"
or
"ro"\&. By default, each temporary file system is mounted with
"nodev,strictatime,mode=0755"\&. These can be disabled by explicitly specifying the corresponding mount options, e\&.g\&.,
"dev"

.sp
This is useful to hide files or directories not relevant to the processes invoked by the unit, while necessary files or directories can be still accessed by combining with

/tmp/

/dev/mem, system ports
/dev/port

"root"
user and group as well as the unit\*(Aqs own user and group to themselves and everything else to the
"nobody"
user and group\&. This is useful to securely detach the user and group databases used by the unit from the rest of the system, and thus to create an effective sandbox environment\&. All files, directories, processes, IPC objects and other resources owned by users/groups not equaling
"root"
or the unit\*(Aqs own will stay visible from within the unit but appear owned by the
"nobody"
user and group\&. If this mode is enabled, all unit processes are run without privileges in the host user namespace (regardless if the unit\*(Aqs own user/group is
"root"
or not)\&. Specifically this means that the process will have zero process capabilities on the host\*(Aqs user namespace, but full capabilities within the service\*(Aqs user namespace\&. Settings such as
\fICapabilityBoundingSet=\fR
will affect only the latter, and there\*(Aqs no way to acquire additional capabilities in the host\*(Aqs user namespace\&. Defaults to off\&.

When this setting is set up by a per\-user instance of the service manager, the mapping of the

This means any file system mount points established or removed by the unit\*(Aqs processes will be private to them and not be visible to the host\&.

File system namespaces are set up individually for each process forked off by the service manager\&. Mounts established in the namespace of the process created by
\fIExecStartPre=\fR

\fIExecStart=\fR

Note that strict system call filters may impact execution and error handling code paths of the service invocation\&. Specifically, access to the
\fBexecve()\fR
system call is required for the execution of the service binary \(em if it is blocked service invocation will necessarily fail\&. Also, if execution of the service binary fails for some reason (for example: missing service executable), the error handling logic might require access to an additional set of system calls in order to process and log this failure correctly\&. It might be necessary to temporarily disable system call filters in order to simplify debugging of such failures\&.
.sp
If you specify both types of this option (i\&.e\&. allow\-listing and deny\-listing), the first encountered will take precedence and will dictate the default action (termination or approval of a system call)\&. Then the next occurrences of this option will add or delete the listed system calls from the set of the filtered system calls, depending of its type and the default action\&.

A reasonable set of system calls used by common system services, excluding any special purpose calls\&.

T}
.TE
.sp 1
Note, that as new system calls are added to the kernel, additional system calls might be added to the groups above\&. Contents of the sets may also change between systemd versions\&. In addition, the list of system calls depends on the kernel version and architecture for which systemd was compiled\&. Use
\fBsystemd\-analyze\ \&syscall\-filter\fR
to list the actual list of system calls in each filter\&.
.sp
Generally, allow\-listing system calls (rather than deny\-listing) is the safer mode of operation\&. It is recommended to enforce system call allow lists for all long\-running system services\&. Specifically, the following lines are a relatively safe basic choice for the majority of system services:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[Service]
SystemCallFilter=@system\-service
SystemCallErrorNumber=EPERM
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Note that various kernel system calls are defined redundantly: there are multiple system calls for executing the same operation\&. For example, the
\fBpidfd_send_signal()\fR
system call may be used to execute operations similar to what can be done with the older
\fBkill()\fR
system call, hence blocking the latter without the former only provides weak protection\&. Since new system calls are added regularly to the kernel as development progresses, keeping system call deny lists comprehensive requires constant work\&. It is thus recommended to use allow\-listing instead, which offers the benefit that new system calls are by default implicitly blocked until the allow list is updated\&.
.sp
Also note that a number of system calls are required to be accessible for the dynamic linker to work\&. The dynamic linker is required for running most regular programs (specifically: all dynamic ELF binaries, which is how most distributions build packaged programs)\&. This means that blocking these system calls (which include
\fBopen()\fR,
\fBopenat()\fR
or
\fBmmap()\fR) will make most programs typically shipped with generic distributions unusable\&.
.sp
It is recommended to combine the file system namespacing related options with
\fISystemCallFilter=~@mount\fR, in order to prohibit the unit\*(Aqs processes to undo the mappings\&. Specifically these are the options

\fBx32\fR,
\fBmips64\-n32\fR,
\fBmips64\-le\-n32\fR, and the special identifier
\fBnative\fR\&. The special identifier
\fBnative\fR
implicitly maps to the native architecture of the system (or more precisely: to the architecture the system manager is compiled for)\&. If running in user mode, or in system mode, but without the
\fBCAP_SYS_ADMIN\fR
capability (e\&.g\&. setting
\fIUser=\fR),
\fINoNewPrivileges=yes\fR
is implied\&. By default, this option is set to the empty list, i\&.e\&. no filtering is applied\&.
.sp
If this setting is used, processes of this unit will only be permitted to call native system calls, and system calls of the specified architectures\&. For the purposes of this option, the x32 architecture is treated as including x86\-64 system calls\&. However, this setting still fulfills its purpose, as explained below, on x32\&.
.sp
System call filtering is not equally effective on all architectures\&. For example, on x86 filtering of network socket\-related calls is not possible, due to ABI limitations \(em a limitation that x86\-64 does not have, however\&. On systems supporting multiple ABIs at the same time \(em such as x86/x86\-64 \(em it is hence recommended to limit the set of permitted system call architectures so that secondary ABIs may not be used to circumvent the restrictions applied to the native ABI of the system\&. In particular, setting
\fISystemCallArchitectures=native\fR
is a good choice for disabling non\-native ABIs\&.
.sp
System call architectures may also be restricted system\-wide via the
\fISystemCallArchitectures=\fR
option in the global configuration\&. See

Note that environment variables are not suitable for passing secrets (such as passwords, key material, \&...) to service processes\&. Environment variables set for a unit are exposed to unprivileged clients via D\-Bus IPC, and generally not understood as being data that requires protection\&. Moreover, environment variables are propagated down the process tree, including across security boundaries (such as setuid/setgid executables), and hence might leak to processes that should not have access to the secret data\&.

\fIStandardInputText=\fR/\fIStandardInputData=\fR

The
\fBfile:\fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR

socket in the file system is specified, a stream socket is connected to it\&. The latter is useful for connecting standard input of processes to arbitrary system services\&.

The
\fBsocket\fR

\fBsystemd.socket\fR(5)

\fBinetd\fR(8)
socket activation daemon\&.

\fBtty\fR

\fBkmsg\fR

The

\fIStandardInput=\fR, see above\&. If
\fIpath\fR
refers to a regular file on the filesystem, it is opened (created if it doesn\*(Aqt exist yet) for writing at the beginning of the file, but without truncating it\&. If standard input and output are directed to the same file path, it is opened only once, for reading as well as writing and duplicated\&. This is particularly useful when the specified path refers to an
\fBAF_UNIX\fR
socket in the file system, as in that case only a single stream connection is created for both input and output\&.
.sp
\fBappend:\fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR
is similar to
\fBfile:\fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR
above, but it opens the file in append mode\&.
.sp
\fBtruncate:\fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR
is similar to
\fBfile:\fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR
above, but it truncates the file when opening it\&. For units with multiple command lines, e\&.g\&.
\fIType=oneshot\fR
services with multiple
\fIExecStart=\fR, or services with
\fIExecCondition=\fR,
\fIExecStartPre=\fR
or
\fIExecStartPost=\fR, the output file is reopened and therefore re\-truncated for each command line\&. If the output file is truncated while another process still has the file open, e\&.g\&. by an
\fIExecReload=\fR
running concurrently with an
\fIExecStart=\fR, and the other process continues writing to the file without adjusting its offset, then the space between the file pointers of the two processes may be filled with
\fBNUL\fR
bytes, producing a sparse file\&. Thus,
\fBtruncate:\fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR
is typically only useful for units where only one process runs at a time, such as services with a single
\fIExecStart=\fR
and no
\fIExecStartPost=\fR,
\fIExecReload=\fR,
\fIExecStop=\fR
or similar\&.

\fBsocket\fR
connects standard output to a socket acquired via socket activation\&. The semantics are similar to the same option of
\fIStandardInput=\fR, see above\&.
.sp
The
\fBfd:\fR\fB\fIname\fR\fR
option connects standard output to a specific, named file descriptor provided by a socket unit\&. A name may be specified as part of this option, following a
":"
character (e\&.g\&.
"fd:foobar")\&. If no name is specified, the name
"stdout"
is implied (i\&.e\&.
"fd"

stream socket, and not a pipe or FIFO that can be re\-opened\&. This means when executing shell scripts the construct
\fBecho "hello" > /dev/stderr\fR

Internally, journal namespaces are implemented through Linux mount namespacing and over\-mounting the directory that contains the relevant

Pass a credential to the unit\&. Credentials are limited\-size binary or textual objects that may be passed to unit processes\&. They are primarily used for passing cryptographic keys (both public and private) or certificates, user account information or identity information from host to services\&. The data is accessible from the unit\*(Aqs processes via the file system, at a read\-only location that (if possible and permitted) is backed by non\-swappable memory\&. The data is only accessible to the user associated with the unit, via the
\fIUser=\fR/\fIDynamicUser=\fR
settings (as well as the superuser)\&. When available, the location of credentials is exported as the
\fI$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY\fR
environment variable to the unit\*(Aqs processes\&.
.sp
The
\fILoadCredential=\fR
setting takes a textual ID to use as name for a credential plus a file system path\&. The ID must be a short ASCII string suitable as filename in the filesystem, and may be chosen freely by the user\&. If the specified path is absolute it is opened as regular file and the credential data is read from it\&. If the absolute path refers to an
\fBAF_UNIX\fR
stream socket in the file system a connection is made to it (only once at unit start\-up) and the credential data read from the connection, providing an easy IPC integration point for dynamically providing credentials from other services\&. If the specified path is not absolute and itself qualifies as valid credential identifier it is understood to refer to a credential that the service manager itself received via the
\fI$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY\fR
environment variable, which may be used to propagate credentials from an invoking environment (e\&.g\&. a container manager that invoked the service manager) into a service\&. The contents of the file/socket may be arbitrary binary or textual data, including newline characters and
\fBNUL\fR
bytes\&. This option may be used multiple times, each time defining an additional credential to pass to the unit\&.
.sp
The credential files/IPC sockets must be accessible to the service manager, but don\*(Aqt have to be directly accessible to the unit\*(Aqs processes: the credential data is read and copied into separate, read\-only copies for the unit that are accessible to appropriately privileged processes\&. This is particularly useful in combination with
\fIDynamicUser=\fR
as this way privileged data can be made available to processes running under a dynamic UID (i\&.e\&. not a previously known one) without having to open up access to all users\&.

Currently, an accumulated credential size limit of 1 MB per unit is enforced\&.

byte (as required for abstract namespace socket names), followed by a random string (consisting of alphadecimal characters), followed by the literal string
"/unit/", followed by the requesting unit name, followed by the literal character
"/", followed by the textual credential ID requested\&. Example:
"\e0adf9d86b6eda275e/unit/foobar\&.service/credx"

The general philosophy is to expose a small curated list of environment variables to processes\&. Services started by the system manager (PID 1) will be started, without additional service\-specific configuration, with just a few environment variables\&.

Note: the process may be also terminated by a signal not sent by systemd\&. In particular the process may send an arbitrary signal to itself in a handler for any of the non\-maskable signals\&. Nevertheless, in the "timeout" and "watchdog" rows above only the signals that systemd sends have been included\&. Moreover, using \fISuccessExitStatus=\fR additional exit statuses may be declared to indicate clean termination, which is not reflected by this table\&.

\fI$PIDFILE\fR

The path to the configured PID file, in case the process is forked off on behalf of a service that uses the
\fIPIDFile=\fR

For system services, when

\fBpam_systemd\fR

.SH "PROCESS EXIT CODES"
.PP
When invoking a unit process the service manager possibly fails to apply the execution parameters configured with the settings above\&. In that case the already created service process will exit with a non\-zero exit code before the configured command line is executed\&. (Or in other words, the child process possibly exits with these error codes, after having been created by the
\fBfork\fR(2)
system call, but before the matching
\fBexecve\fR(2)
system call is called\&.) Specifically, exit codes defined by the C library, by the LSB specification and by the systemd service manager itself are used\&.
