.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBsystemd\-analyze\fR
may be used to determine system boot\-up performance statistics and retrieve other state and tracing information from the system and service manager, and to verify the correctness of unit files\&. It is also used to access special functions useful for advanced system manager debugging\&.
.PP
If no command is passed,
\fBsystemd\-analyze time\fR
is implied\&.
.SS "systemd\-analyze time"
.PP
This command prints the time spent in the kernel before userspace has been reached, the time spent in the initial RAM disk (initrd) before normal system userspace has been reached, and the time normal system userspace took to initialize\&. Note that these measurements simply measure the time passed up to the point where all system services have been spawned, but not necessarily until they fully finished initialization or the disk is idle\&.
.PP
\fBExample\ \&1.\ \&Show how long the boot took\fR
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

# in a container

# on a real machine
$ systemd\-analyze time

.fi
.if n \{\

.\}
.SS "systemd\-analyze blame"
.PP
This command prints a list of all running units, ordered by the time they took to initialize\&. This information may be used to optimize boot\-up times\&. Note that the output might be misleading as the initialization of one service might be slow simply because it waits for the initialization of another service to complete\&. Also note:
\fBsystemd\-analyze blame\fR
doesn\*(Aqt display results for services with
\fIType=simple\fR, because systemd considers such services to be started immediately, hence no measurement of the initialization delays can be done\&. Also note that this command only shows the time units took for starting up, it does not show how long unit jobs spent in the execution queue\&. In particular it shows the time units spent in
"activating"
state, which is not defined for units such as device units that transition directly from
"inactive"
to
"active"\&. This command hence gives an impression of the performance of program code, but cannot accurately reflect latency introduced by waiting for hardware and similar events\&.

.SS "systemd\-analyze critical\-chain [\fIUNIT\fR\&.\&.\&.]"
.PP
This command prints a tree of the time\-critical chain of units (for each of the specified
\fIUNIT\fRs or for the default target otherwise)\&. The time after the unit is active or started is printed after the "@" character\&. The time the unit takes to start is printed after the "+" character\&. Note that the output might be misleading as the initialization of services might depend on socket activation and because of the parallel execution of units\&. Also, similar to the
\fBblame\fR
command, this only takes into account the time units spent in
"activating"
state, and hence does not cover units that never went through an
"activating"
state (such as device units that transition directly from
"inactive"
to
"active")\&. Moreover it does not show information on jobs (and in particular not jobs that timed out)\&.

.SS "systemd\-analyze security [\fIUNIT\fR\&.\&.\&.]"
.PP
This command analyzes the security and sandboxing settings of one or more specified service units\&. If at least one unit name is specified the security settings of the specified service units are inspected and a detailed analysis is shown\&. If no unit name is specified, all currently loaded, long\-running service units are inspected and a terse table with results shown\&. The command checks for various security\-related service settings, assigning each a numeric "exposure level" value, depending on how important a setting is\&. It then calculates an overall exposure level for the whole unit, which is an estimation in the range 0\&.0\&...10\&.0 indicating how exposed a service is security\-wise\&. High exposure levels indicate very little applied sandboxing\&. Low exposure levels indicate tight sandboxing and strongest security restrictions\&. Note that this only analyzes the per\-service security features systemd itself implements\&. This means that any additional security mechanisms applied by the service code itself are not accounted for\&. The exposure level determined this way should not be misunderstood: a high exposure level neither means that there is no effective sandboxing applied by the service code itself, nor that the service is actually vulnerable to remote or local attacks\&. High exposure levels do indicate however that most likely the service might benefit from additional settings applied to them\&.
.PP
Please note that many of the security and sandboxing settings individually can be circumvented \(em unless combined with others\&. For example, if a service retains the privilege to establish or undo mount points many of the sandboxing options can be undone by the service code itself\&. Due to that is essential that each service uses the most comprehensive and strict sandboxing and security settings possible\&. The tool will take into account some of these combinations and relationships between the settings, but not all\&. Also note that the security and sandboxing settings analyzed here only apply to the operations executed by the service code itself\&. If a service has access to an IPC system (such as D\-Bus) it might request operations from other services that are not subject to the same restrictions\&. Any comprehensive security and sandboxing analysis is hence incomplete if the IPC access policy is not validated too\&.

\fB\-\-order\fR
is passed, only dependencies of type

\fB\-\-require\fR
is passed, only dependencies of type
\fIRequires=\fR,
\fIRequisite=\fR,

\fIConflicts=\fR
are shown\&. If neither is passed, this shows dependencies of all these types\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-from\-pattern=\fR, \fB\-\-to\-pattern=\fR
.RS 4
When used in conjunction with the
\fBdot\fR
command (see above), this selects which relationships are shown in the dependency graph\&. Both options require a
\fBglob\fR(7)
pattern as an argument, which will be matched against the left\-hand and the right\-hand, respectively, nodes of a relationship\&.
.sp
Each of these can be used more than once, in which case the unit name must match one of the values\&. When tests for both sides of the relation are present, a relation must pass both tests to be shown\&. When patterns are also specified as positional arguments, they must match at least one side of the relation\&. In other words, patterns specified with those two options will trim the list of edges matched by the positional arguments, if any are given, and fully determine the list of edges shown otherwise\&.

"\&.host"
is used in place of the container name, a connection to the local system is made (which is useful to connect to a specific user\*(Aqs user bus:

\fBemerg\fR,
\fBalert\fR,
\fBcrit\fR,

.RE
.PP
\fI$SYSTEMD_LOG_COLOR\fR
.RS 4
A boolean\&. If true, messages written to the tty will be colored according to priority\&.

This setting is only useful when messages are written directly to the terminal, because
\fBjournalctl\fR(1)

\fI$SYSTEMD_LOG_TIME\fR

This setting is only useful when messages are written directly to the terminal or a file, because
\fBjournalctl\fR(1)

.RE
.PP
\fI$SYSTEMD_LOG_LOCATION\fR
.RS 4
A boolean\&. If true, messages will be prefixed with a filename and line number in the source code where the message originates\&.

Note that the log location is often attached as metadata to journal entries anyway\&. Including it directly in the message text can nevertheless be convenient when debugging programs\&.

\fI$SYSTEMD_PAGER\fR
.RS 4
Pager to use when
\fB\-\-no\-pager\fR
is not given; overrides
\fI$PAGER\fR\&. If neither
\fI$SYSTEMD_PAGER\fR
nor
\fI$PAGER\fR
are set, a set of well\-known pager implementations are tried in turn, including
\fBless\fR(1)
and
\fBmore\fR(1), until one is found\&. If no pager implementation is discovered no pager is invoked\&. Setting this environment variable to an empty string or the value
"cat"
is equivalent to passing
\fB\-\-no\-pager\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fI$SYSTEMD_LESS\fR
.RS 4
Override the options passed to
\fBless\fR
(by default
"FRSXMK")\&.
.sp
Users might want to change two options in particular:
.PP
\fBK\fR
.RS 4
This option instructs the pager to exit immediately when
Ctrl+C
is pressed\&. To allow
\fBless\fR
to handle
Ctrl+C
itself to switch back to the pager command prompt, unset this option\&.
.sp
If the value of
\fI$SYSTEMD_LESS\fR
does not include
"K", and the pager that is invoked is
\fBless\fR,
Ctrl+C
will be ignored by the executable, and needs to be handled by the pager\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBX\fR
.RS 4
This option instructs the pager to not send termcap initialization and deinitialization strings to the terminal\&. It is set by default to allow command output to remain visible in the terminal even after the pager exits\&. Nevertheless, this prevents some pager functionality from working, in particular paged output cannot be scrolled with the mouse\&.
.RE
.sp
See
\fBless\fR(1)
for more discussion\&.
.RE
.PP
\fI$SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET\fR
.RS 4
Override the charset passed to
\fBless\fR
(by default
"utf\-8", if the invoking terminal is determined to be UTF\-8 compatible)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fI$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean argument\&. When true, the "secure" mode of the pager is enabled; if false, disabled\&. If
\fI$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE\fR
is not set at all, secure mode is enabled if the effective UID is not the same as the owner of the login session, see
\fBgeteuid\fR(2)
and
\fBsd_pid_get_owner_uid\fR(3)\&. In secure mode,
\fBLESSSECURE=1\fR
will be set when invoking the pager, and the pager shall disable commands that open or create new files or start new subprocesses\&. When
\fI$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE\fR
is not set at all, pagers which are not known to implement secure mode will not be used\&. (Currently only
\fBless\fR(1)
implements secure mode\&.)
.sp
Note: when commands are invoked with elevated privileges, for example under
\fBsudo\fR(8)
or
\fBpkexec\fR(1), care must be taken to ensure that unintended interactive features are not enabled\&. "Secure" mode for the pager may be enabled automatically as describe above\&. Setting
\fISYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE=0\fR
or not removing it from the inherited environment allows the user to invoke arbitrary commands\&. Note that if the
\fI$SYSTEMD_PAGER\fR
or
\fI$PAGER\fR
variables are to be honoured,
\fI$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE\fR
must be set too\&. It might be reasonable to completely disable the pager using
\fB\-\-no\-pager\fR
instead\&.
.RE
.PP
\fI$SYSTEMD_COLORS\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean argument\&. When true,
\fBsystemd\fR
and related utilities will use colors in their output, otherwise the output will be monochrome\&. Additionally, the variable can take one of the following special values:
"16",
"256"
to restrict the use of colors to the base 16 or 256 ANSI colors, respectively\&. This can be specified to override the automatic decision based on
\fI$TERM\fR
and what the console is connected to\&.
.RE
.PP
\fI$SYSTEMD_URLIFY\fR
