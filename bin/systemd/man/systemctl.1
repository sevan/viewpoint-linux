This function is intended to generate human\-readable output\&. If you are looking for computer\-parsable output, use

.sp
systemd implicitly loads units as necessary, so just running the
\fBstatus\fR

The dot ("●") uses color on supported terminals to summarize the unit state at a glance\&. Along with its color, its shape varies according to its state:
"inactive"
or
"maintenance"
is a white circle ("○"),
"active"
is a green dot ("●"),
"deactivating"
is a white dot,
"failed"
or
"error"
is a red cross ("\(mu"), and
"reloading"
is a green clockwise circle arrow ("↻")\&.
.sp
The "Loaded:" line in the output will show
"loaded"
if the unit has been loaded into memory\&. Other possible values for "Loaded:" include:
"error"
if there was a problem loading it,
"not\-found"
if no unit file was found for this unit,
"bad\-setting"
if an essential unit file setting could not be parsed and
"masked"
if the unit file has been masked\&. Along with showing the path to the unit file, this line will also show the enablement state\&. Enabled commands start at boot\&. See the full table of possible enablement states \(em including the definition of
"masked"
\(em in the documentation for the
\fBis\-enabled\fR
command\&.
.sp
The "Active:" line shows active state\&. The value is usually
"active"
or
"inactive"\&. Active could mean started, bound, plugged in, etc depending on the unit type\&. The unit could also be in process of changing states, reporting a state of
"activating"
or
"deactivating"\&. A special
"failed"
state is entered when the service failed in some way, such as a crash, exiting with an error code or timing out\&. If the failed state is entered the cause will be logged for later reference\&.
.RE

\fBshow\fR [\fIPATTERN\fR\&...|\fIJOB\fR\&...]
.RS 4
Show properties of one or more units, jobs, or the manager itself\&. If no argument is specified, properties of the manager will be shown\&. If a unit name is specified, properties of the unit are shown, and if a job ID is specified, properties of the job are shown\&. By default, empty properties are suppressed\&. Use
\fB\-\-all\fR
to show those too\&. To select specific properties to show, use
\fB\-\-property=\fR\&. This command is intended to be used whenever computer\-parsable output is required\&. Use
\fBstatus\fR
if you are looking for formatted human\-readable output\&.
.sp
Many properties shown by
\fBsystemctl show\fR
map directly to configuration settings of the system and service manager and its unit files\&. Note that the properties shown by the command are generally more low\-level, normalized versions of the original configuration settings and expose runtime state in addition to configuration\&. For example, properties shown for service units include the service\*(Aqs current main process identifier as
"MainPID"
(which is runtime state), and time settings are always exposed as properties ending in the
"\&...USec"
suffix even if a matching configuration options end in
"\&...Sec", because microseconds is the normalized time unit used internally by the system and service manager\&.
.sp
For details about many of these properties, see the documentation of the D\-Bus interface backing these properties, see

\fBlist\-dependencies\fR [\fIUNIT\fR\&.\&.\&.]

Shows units required and wanted by the specified units\&. This recursively lists units following the
\fIRequires=\fR,
\fIRequisite=\fR,
\fIConsistsOf=\fR,
\fIWants=\fR,
\fIBindsTo=\fR
dependencies\&. If no units are specified,
default\&.target

By default, only target units are recursively expanded\&. When
\fB\-\-all\fR
is passed, all other units are recursively expanded as well\&.
.sp
Options
\fB\-\-reverse\fR,
\fB\-\-after\fR,
\fB\-\-before\fR
may be used to change what types of dependencies are shown\&.
.sp
Note that this command only lists units currently loaded into memory by the service manager\&. In particular, this command is not suitable to get a comprehensive list at all reverse dependencies on a specific unit, as it won\*(Aqt list the dependencies declared by units currently not loaded\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBstart \fR\fB\fIPATTERN\fR\fR\fB\&...\fR
.RS 4
Start (activate) one or more units specified on the command line\&.
.sp
Note that unit glob patterns expand to names of units currently in memory\&. Units which are not active and are not in a failed state usually are not in memory, and will not be matched by any pattern\&. In addition, in case of instantiated units, systemd is often unaware of the instance name until the instance has been started\&. Therefore, using glob patterns with
\fBstart\fR
has limited usefulness\&. Also, secondary alias names of units are not considered\&.
.sp
Option
\fB\-\-all\fR
may be used to also operate on inactive units which are referenced by other loaded units\&. Note that this is not the same as operating on "all" possible units, because as the previous paragraph describes, such a list is ill\-defined\&. Nevertheless,
\fBsystemctl start \-\-all \fR\fB\fIGLOB\fR\fR
may be useful if all the units that should match the pattern are pulled in by some target which is known to be loaded\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBstop \fR\fB\fIPATTERN\fR\fR\fB\&...\fR
.RS 4
Stop (deactivate) one or more units specified on the command line\&.
.sp
This command will fail if the unit does not exist or if stopping of the unit is prohibited (see
\fIRefuseManualStop=\fR
in
\fBsystemd.unit\fR(5))\&. It will
\fInot\fR
fail if any of the commands configured to stop the unit (\fIExecStop=\fR, etc\&.) fail, because the manager will still forcibly terminate the unit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBreload \fR\fB\fIPATTERN\fR\fR\fB\&...\fR
.RS 4
Asks all units listed on the command line to reload their configuration\&. Note that this will reload the service\-specific configuration, not the unit configuration file of systemd\&. If you want systemd to reload the configuration file of a unit, use the
\fBdaemon\-reload\fR
command\&. In other words: for the example case of Apache, this will reload Apache\*(Aqs
httpd\&.conf
in the web server, not the
apache\&.service
systemd unit file\&.

This command should not be confused with the

command\&.

\fBrestart \fR\fB\fIPATTERN\fR\fR\fB\&...\fR
.RS 4
Stop and then start one or more units specified on the command line\&. If the units are not running yet, they will be started\&.
.sp
Note that restarting a unit with this command does not necessarily flush out all of the unit\*(Aqs resources before it is started again\&. For example, the per\-service file descriptor storage facility (see
\fIFileDescriptorStoreMax=\fR
in
\fBsystemd.service\fR(5)) will remain intact as long as the unit has a job pending, and is only cleared when the unit is fully stopped and no jobs are pending anymore\&. If it is intended that the file descriptor store is flushed out, too, during a restart operation an explicit

Set the specified unit properties at runtime where this is supported\&. This allows changing configuration parameter properties such as resource control settings at runtime\&. Not all properties may be changed at runtime, but many resource control settings (primarily those in

.sp
Example:

If the specified unit appears to be inactive, the changes will be only stored on disk as described previously hence they will be effective when the unit will be started\&.

If the optional argument

\fBreset\-failed [\fR\fB\fIPATTERN\fR\fR\fB\&...]\fR

Reset the
"failed"

"failed"
state and its exit code and status is recorded for introspection by the administrator until the service is stopped/re\-started or reset with this command\&.
.sp
In addition to resetting the
"failed"
state of a unit it also resets various other per\-unit properties: the start rate limit counter of all unit types is reset to zero, as is the restart counter of service units\&. Thus, if a unit\*(Aqs start limit (as configured with

.RS 4
Enable one or more units or unit instances\&. This will create a set of symlinks, as encoded in the [Install] sections of the indicated unit files\&. After the symlinks have been created, the system manager configuration is reloaded (in a way equivalent to
\fBdaemon\-reload\fR), in order to ensure the changes are taken into account immediately\&. Note that this does
\fInot\fR
have the effect of also starting any of the units being enabled\&. If this is desired, combine this command with the
\fB\-\-now\fR
switch, or invoke
\fBstart\fR
with appropriate arguments later\&. Note that in case of unit instance enablement (i\&.e\&. enablement of units of the form
foo@bar\&.service), symlinks named the same as instances are created in the unit configuration directory, however they point to the single template unit file they are instantiated from\&.
.sp
This command expects either valid unit names (in which case various unit file directories are automatically searched for unit files with appropriate names), or absolute paths to unit files (in which case these files are read directly)\&. If a specified unit file is located outside of the usual unit file directories, an additional symlink is created, linking it into the unit configuration path, thus ensuring it is found when requested by commands such as
\fBstart\fR\&. The file system where the linked unit files are located must be accessible when systemd is started (e\&.g\&. anything underneath
/home/

/var/
is not allowed, unless those directories are located on the root file system)\&.
.sp
This command will print the file system operations executed\&. This output may be suppressed by passing
\fB\-\-quiet\fR\&.
.sp
Note that this operation creates only the symlinks suggested in the [Install] section of the unit files\&. While this command is the recommended way to manipulate the unit configuration directory, the administrator is free to make additional changes manually by placing or removing symlinks below this directory\&. This is particularly useful to create configurations that deviate from the suggested default installation\&. In this case, the administrator must make sure to invoke
\fBdaemon\-reload\fR
manually as necessary, in order to ensure the changes are taken into account\&.
.sp
Enabling units should not be confused with starting (activating) units, as done by the
\fBstart\fR
command\&. Enabling and starting units is orthogonal: units may be enabled without being started and started without being enabled\&. Enabling simply hooks the unit into various suggested places (for example, so that the unit is automatically started on boot or when a particular kind of hardware is plugged in)\&. Starting actually spawns the daemon process (in case of service units), or binds the socket (in case of socket units), and so on\&.
.sp
Depending on whether
\fB\-\-system\fR,
\fB\-\-user\fR,
\fB\-\-runtime\fR, or
\fB\-\-global\fR
is specified, this enables the unit for the system, for the calling user only, for only this boot of the system, or for all future logins of all users\&. Note that in the last case, no systemd daemon configuration is reloaded\&.

\fBX\fR

This option instructs the pager to not send termcap initialization and deinitialization strings to the terminal\&.

\fI$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE\fR

Takes a boolean argument\&. When true, the "secure" mode of the pager is enabled; if false, disabled\&. If
\fI$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE\fR

\fBgeteuid\fR(2)

\fBsd_pid_get_owner_uid\fR(3)\&. In secure mode,
\fBLESSSECURE=1\fR
will be set when invoking the pager, and the pager shall disable commands that open or create new files or start new subprocesses\&. When
\fI$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE\fR
is not set at all, pagers which are not known to implement secure mode will not be used\&. (Currently only
\fBless\fR(1)
implements secure mode\&.)
.sp
Note: when commands are invoked with elevated privileges, for example under
\fBsudo\fR(8)
or
\fBpkexec\fR(1), care must be taken to ensure that unintended interactive features are not enabled\&. "Secure" mode for the pager may be enabled automatically as describe above\&. Setting
\fISYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE=0\fR
or not removing it from the inherited environment allows the user to invoke arbitrary commands\&. Note that if the
\fI$SYSTEMD_PAGER\fR

\fI$PAGER\fR

\fI$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE\fR
