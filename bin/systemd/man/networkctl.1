.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBnetworkctl\fR\ 'u
\fBnetworkctl\fR [OPTIONS...] COMMAND [LINK...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBnetworkctl\fR
may be used to introspect the state of the network links as seen by
\fBsystemd\-networkd\fR\&. Please refer to

\fBlldp\fR [\fIPATTERN\&...\fR]
.RS 4
Show discovered LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) neighbors\&. If one or more
\fIPATTERN\fRs are specified only neighbors on those interfaces are shown\&. Otherwise shows discovered neighbors on all interfaces\&. Note that for this feature to work,
\fILLDP=\fR
must be turned on for the specific interface, see
\fBsystemd.network\fR(5)
for details\&.

.RS 4
Send a FORCERENEW message to all connected clients, triggering DHCP reconfiguration\&. Takes interface name or index number\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBreconfigure\fR \fIDEVICE\&...\fR
.RS 4
Reconfigure network interfaces\&. Takes interface name or index number\&. Note that this does not reload
\&.netdev
or
\&.network
corresponding to the specified interface\&. So, if you edit config files, it is necessary to call
\fBnetworkctl reload\fR
first to apply new settings\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBreload\fR
.RS 4
Reload
\&.netdev
and
\&.network
files\&. If a new
\&.netdev
file is found, then the corresponding netdev is created\&. Note that even if an existing
\&.netdev
is modified or removed,
\fBsystemd\-networkd\fR
does not update or remove the netdev\&. If a new, modified or removed
\&.network
file is found, then all interfaces which match the file are reconfigured\&.
