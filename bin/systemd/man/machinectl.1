The following commands are understood:
.SS "Machine Commands"
.PP
\fBlist\fR
.RS 4
List currently running (online) virtual machines and containers\&. To enumerate machine images that can be started, use
\fBlist\-images\fR
(see below)\&. Note that this command hides the special
"\&.host"
machine by default\&. Use the
\fB\-\-all\fR
switch to show it\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBstatus\fR \fINAME\fR\&...
.RS 4
Show runtime status information about one or more virtual machines and containers, followed by the most recent log data from the journal\&. This function is intended to generate human\-readable output\&. If you are looking for computer\-parsable output, use
\fBshow\fR
instead\&. Note that the log data shown is reported by the virtual machine or container manager, and frequently contains console output of the machine, but not necessarily journal contents of the machine itself\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBshow\fR [\fINAME\fR\&...]
.RS 4
Show properties of one or more registered virtual machines or containers or the manager itself\&. If no argument is specified, properties of the manager will be shown\&. If a NAME is specified, properties of this virtual machine or container are shown\&. By default, empty properties are suppressed\&. Use
\fB\-\-all\fR
to show those too\&. To select specific properties to show, use
\fB\-\-property=\fR\&. This command is intended to be used whenever computer\-parsable output is required, and does not print the control group tree or journal entries\&. Use
\fBstatus\fR
if you are looking for formatted human\-readable output\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBstart\fR \fINAME\fR\&...
.RS 4
Start a container as a system service, using
\fBsystemd-nspawn\fR(1)\&. This starts
systemd\-nspawn@\&.service, instantiated for the specified machine name, similar to the effect of
\fBsystemctl start\fR
on the service name\&.
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR
looks for a container image by the specified name in
/var/lib/machines/
(and other search paths, see below) and runs it\&. Use
\fBlist\-images\fR
(see below) for listing available container images to start\&.
.sp
Note that
\fBsystemd-machined.service\fR(8)
also interfaces with a variety of other container and VM managers,
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR
is just one implementation of it\&. Most of the commands available in
\fBmachinectl\fR
may be used on containers or VMs controlled by other managers, not just
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR\&. Starting VMs and container images on those managers requires manager\-specific tools\&.
.sp
To interactively start a container on the command line with full access to the container\*(Aqs console, please invoke
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR
directly\&. To stop a running container use
\fBmachinectl poweroff\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBlogin\fR [\fINAME\fR]
.RS 4
Open an interactive terminal login session in a container or on the local host\&. If an argument is supplied, it refers to the container machine to connect to\&. If none is specified, or the container name is specified as the empty string, or the special machine name
"\&.host"
(see below) is specified, the connection is made to the local host instead\&. This will create a TTY connection to a specific container or the local host and asks for the execution of a getty on it\&. Note that this is only supported for containers running
\fBsystemd\fR(1)
as init system\&.
.sp
This command will open a full login prompt on the container or the local host, which then asks for username and password\&. Use
\fBshell\fR
(see below) or
\fBsystemd-run\fR(1)
with the
\fB\-\-machine=\fR
switch to directly invoke a single command, either interactively or in the background\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBshell\fR [[\fINAME\fR@]\fINAME\fR [\fIPATH\fR [\fIARGUMENTS\fR\&...]]]
.RS 4
Open an interactive shell session in a container or on the local host\&. The first argument refers to the container machine to connect to\&. If none is specified, or the machine name is specified as the empty string, or the special machine name
"\&.host"
(see below) is specified, the connection is made to the local host instead\&. This works similar to
\fBlogin\fR
but immediately invokes a user process\&. This command runs the specified executable with the specified arguments, or the default shell for the user if none is specified, or
/bin/sh
if no default shell is found\&. By default,
\fB\-\-uid=\fR, or by prefixing the machine name with a username and an
"@"
character, a different user may be selected\&. Use
\fB\-\-setenv=\fR
to set environment variables for the executed process\&.
.sp
Note that
\fBmachinectl shell\fR
does not propagate the exit code/status of the invoked shell process\&. Use
\fBsystemd\-run\fR
instead if that information is required (see below)\&.
.sp
When using the
\fBshell\fR
command without arguments, (thus invoking the executed shell or command on the local host), it is in many ways similar to a
\fBsu\fR(1)
session, but, unlike
\fBsu\fR, completely isolates the new session from the originating session, so that it shares no process or session properties, and is in a clean and well\-defined state\&. It will be tracked in a new utmp, login, audit, security and keyring session, and will not inherit any environment variables or resource limits, among other properties\&.
.sp
Note that
\fBsystemd-run\fR(1)
with its
\fB\-\-machine=\fR
switch may be used in place of the
\fBmachinectl shell\fR
command, and allows non\-interactive operation, more detailed and low\-level configuration of the invoked unit, as well as access to runtime and exit code/status information of the invoked shell process\&. In particular, use
\fBsystemd\-run\fR\*(Aqs
\fB\-\-wait\fR
switch to propagate exit status information of the invoked process\&. Use
\fBsystemd\-run\fR\*(Aqs
\fB\-\-pty\fR
switch for acquiring an interactive shell, similar to
\fBmachinectl shell\fR\&. In general,
\fBsystemd\-run\fR
is preferable for scripting purposes\&. However, note that
\fBsystemd\-run\fR
might require higher privileges than
\fBmachinectl shell\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBenable\fR \fINAME\fR\&..., \fBdisable\fR \fINAME\fR\&...
.RS 4
Enable or disable a container as a system service to start at system boot, using
\fBsystemd-nspawn\fR(1)\&. This enables or disables
systemd\-nspawn@\&.service, instantiated for the specified machine name, similar to the effect of
\fBsystemctl enable\fR
or
\fBsystemctl disable\fR
on the service name\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBpoweroff\fR \fINAME\fR\&...
.RS 4
Power off one or more containers\&. This will trigger a reboot by sending SIGRTMIN+4 to the container\*(Aqs init process, which causes systemd\-compatible init systems to shut down cleanly\&. Use
\fBstop\fR
as alias for
\fBpoweroff\fR\&. This operation does not work on containers that do not run a
\fBsystemd\fR(1)\-compatible init system, such as sysvinit\&. Use
\fBterminate\fR
(see below) to immediately terminate a container or VM, without cleanly shutting it down\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBreboot\fR \fINAME\fR\&...
.RS 4
Reboot one or more containers\&. This will trigger a reboot by sending SIGINT to the container\*(Aqs init process, which is roughly equivalent to pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del on a non\-containerized system, and is compatible with containers running any system manager\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBterminate\fR \fINAME\fR\&...
.RS 4
Immediately terminates a virtual machine or container, without cleanly shutting it down\&. This kills all processes of the virtual machine or container and deallocates all resources attached to that instance\&. Use
\fBpoweroff\fR
to issue a clean shutdown request\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBkill\fR \fINAME\fR\&...
.RS 4
Send a signal to one or more processes of the virtual machine or container\&. This means processes as seen by the host, not the processes inside the virtual machine or container\&. Use
\fB\-\-kill\-who=\fR
to select which process to kill\&. Use
\fB\-\-signal=\fR
to select the signal to send\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBbind\fR \fINAME\fR \fIPATH\fR [\fIPATH\fR]
.RS 4
Bind mounts a file or directory from the host into the specified container\&. The first path argument is the source file or directory on the host, the second path argument is the destination file or directory in the container\&. When the latter is omitted, the destination path in the container is the same as the source path on the host\&. When combined with the
\fB\-\-read\-only\fR
switch, a ready\-only bind mount is created\&. When combined with the
\fB\-\-mkdir\fR
switch, the destination path is first created before the mount is applied\&. Note that this option is currently only supported for
\fBsystemd-nspawn\fR(1)
containers, and only if user namespacing (\fB\-\-private\-users\fR) is not used\&. This command supports bind mounting directories, regular files, device nodes,
\fBAF_UNIX\fR
socket nodes, as well as FIFOs\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBcopy\-to\fR \fINAME\fR \fIPATH\fR [\fIPATH\fR]
.RS 4
Copies files or directories from the host system into a running container\&. Takes a container name, followed by the source path on the host and the destination path in the container\&. If the destination path is omitted, the same as the source path is used\&.
.sp
If host and container share the same user and group namespace, file ownership by numeric user ID and group ID is preserved for the copy, otherwise all files and directories in the copy will be owned by the root user and group (UID/GID 0)\&.
.RE

Show a list of locally installed container and VM images\&. This enumerates all raw disk images and container directories and subvolumes in
/var/lib/machines/
(and other search paths, see below)\&. Use
\fBstart\fR
(see above) to run a container off one of the listed images\&. Note that, by default, containers whose name begins with a dot ("\&.") are not shown\&. To show these too, specify
\fB\-\-all\fR\&. Note that a special image
"\&.host"
always implicitly exists and refers to the image the host itself is booted from\&.
.RE

.RE
.PP
\fBshow\-image\fR [\fINAME\fR\&...]

Show properties of one or more registered virtual machine or container images, or the manager itself\&. If no argument is specified, properties of the manager will be shown\&. If a NAME is specified, properties of this virtual machine or container image are shown\&. By default, empty properties are suppressed\&. Use
\fB\-\-all\fR

if you are looking for formatted human\-readable output\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBclone\fR \fINAME\fR \fINAME\fR
.RS 4
Clones a container or VM image\&. The arguments specify the name of the image to clone and the name of the newly cloned image\&. Note that plain directory container images are cloned into btrfs subvolume images with this command, if the underlying file system supports this\&. Note that cloning a container or VM image is optimized for file systems that support copy\-on\-write, and might not be efficient on others, due to file system limitations\&.
.sp
Note that this command leaves hostname, machine ID and all other settings that could identify the instance unmodified\&. The original image and the cloned copy will hence share these credentials, and it might be necessary to manually change them in the copy\&.
.sp
If combined with the
\fB\-\-read\-only\fR
switch a read\-only cloned image is created\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBrename\fR \fINAME\fR \fINAME\fR

Renames a container or VM image\&. The arguments specify the name of the image to rename and the new name of the image\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBread\-only\fR \fINAME\fR [\fIBOOL\fR]
.RS 4
Marks or (unmarks) a container or VM image read\-only\&. Takes a VM or container image name, followed by a boolean as arguments\&. If the boolean is omitted, positive is implied, i\&.e\&. the image is marked read\-only\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBremove\fR \fINAME\fR\&...

Removes one or more container or VM images\&. The special image
"\&.host", which refers to the host\*(Aqs own directory tree, may not be removed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBset\-limit\fR [\fINAME\fR] \fIBYTES\fR
.RS 4
Sets the maximum size in bytes that a specific container or VM image, or all images, may grow up to on disk (disk quota)\&. Takes either one or two parameters\&. The first, optional parameter refers to a container or VM image name\&. If specified, the size limit of the specified image is changed\&. If omitted, the overall size limit of the sum of all images stored locally is changed\&. The final argument specifies the size limit in bytes, possibly suffixed by the usual K, M, G, T units\&. If the size limit shall be disabled, specify
"\-"
as size\&.
.sp
Note that per\-container size limits are only supported on btrfs file systems\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBclean\fR
.RS 4
Remove hidden VM or container images (or all)\&. This command removes all hidden machine images from
/var/lib/machines/, i\&.e\&. those whose name begins with a dot\&. Use
\fBmachinectl list\-images \-\-all\fR
to see a list of all machine images, including the hidden ones\&.
.sp
When combined with the
\fB\-\-all\fR
switch removes all images, not just hidden ones\&. This command effectively empties
/var/lib/machines/\&.
.sp
Note that commands such as
\fBmachinectl pull\-tar\fR
or
\fBmachinectl pull\-raw\fR
usually create hidden, read\-only, unmodified machine images from the downloaded image first, before cloning a writable working copy of it, in order to avoid duplicate downloads in case of images that are reused multiple times\&. Use
\fBmachinectl clean\fR
to remove old, hidden images created this way\&.

.SS "Image Transfer Commands"
.PP
\fBpull\-tar\fR \fIURL\fR [\fINAME\fR]
.RS 4
Downloads a
\&.tar
container image from the specified URL, and makes it available under the specified local machine name\&. The URL must be of type
"http://"
or
"https://", and must refer to a
\&.tar,
\&.tar\&.gz,
\&.tar\&.xz
or
\&.tar\&.bz2
archive file\&. If the local machine name is omitted, it is automatically derived from the last component of the URL, with its suffix removed\&.
.sp
The image is verified before it is made available, unless
\fB\-\-verify=no\fR
is specified\&. Verification is done either via an inline signed file with the name of the image and the suffix
\&.sha256
or via separate
SHA256SUMS
and
SHA256SUMS\&.gpg
files\&. The signature files need to be made available on the same web server, under the same URL as the
\&.tar
file\&. With
\fB\-\-verify=checksum\fR, only the SHA256 checksum for the file is verified, based on the
\&.sha256
suffixed file or the
SHA256SUMS
file\&. With
\fB\-\-verify=signature\fR, the sha checksum file is first verified with the inline signature in the
\&.sha256
file or the detached GPG signature file
SHA256SUMS\&.gpg\&. The public key for this verification step needs to be available in
/usr/lib/systemd/import\-pubring\&.gpg
or
/etc/systemd/import\-pubring\&.gpg\&.
.sp
The container image will be downloaded and stored in a read\-only subvolume in
/var/lib/machines/
that is named after the specified URL and its HTTP etag\&. A writable snapshot is then taken from this subvolume, and named after the specified local name\&. This behavior ensures that creating multiple container instances of the same URL is efficient, as multiple downloads are not necessary\&. In order to create only the read\-only image, and avoid creating its writable snapshot, specify
"\-"
as local machine name\&.
.sp
Note that the read\-only subvolume is prefixed with
\&.tar\-, and is thus not shown by
\fBlist\-images\fR, unless
\fB\-\-all\fR

\fBpull\-raw\fR \fIURL\fR [\fINAME\fR]

Downloads a

container or VM disk image from the specified URL, and makes it available under the specified local machine name\&. The URL must be of type
"http://"
or
"https://"\&. The container image must either be a
\&.qcow2
or raw disk image, optionally compressed as
\&.gz,
\&.xz, or
\&.bz2\&. If the local machine name is omitted, it is automatically derived from the last component of the URL, with its suffix removed\&.
.sp
Image verification is identical for raw and tar images (see above)\&.
.sp
If the downloaded image is in
\&.qcow2
format it is converted into a raw image file before it is made available\&.
.sp
Downloaded images of this type will be placed as read\-only
\&.raw
file in
/var/lib/machines/\&. A local, writable (reflinked) copy is then made under the specified local machine name\&. To omit creation of the local, writable copy pass
"\-"
as local machine name\&.

Similar to the behavior of
\fBpull\-tar\fR, the read\-only image is prefixed with
\&.raw\-, and thus not shown by

Imports a TAR or RAW container or VM image, and places it under the specified name in
/var/lib/machines/\&. When
\fBimport\-tar\fR
is used, the file specified as the first argument should be a tar archive, possibly compressed with xz, gzip or bzip2\&. It will then be unpacked into its own subvolume in
/var/lib/machines/\&. When

.SH "MACHINE AND IMAGE NAMES"
.PP
The
\fBmachinectl\fR
tool operates on machines and images whose names must be chosen following strict rules\&. Machine names must be suitable for use as hostnames following a conservative subset of DNS and UNIX/Linux semantics\&. Specifically, they must consist of one or more non\-empty label strings, separated by dots\&. No leading or trailing dots are allowed\&. No sequences of multiple dots are allowed\&. The label strings may only consist of alphanumeric characters as well as the dash and underscore\&. The maximum length of a machine name is 64 characters\&.
.PP
A special machine with the name
"\&.host"
refers to the running host system itself\&. This is useful for execution operations or inspecting the host system as well\&. Note that
\fBmachinectl list\fR
will not show this special machine unless the
\fB\-\-all\fR
switch is specified\&.
.PP
Requirements on image names are less strict, however, they must be valid UTF\-8, must be suitable as file names (hence not be the single or double dot, and not include a slash), and may not contain control characters\&. Since many operations search for an image by the name of a requested machine, it is recommended to name images in the same strict fashion as machines\&.
.PP
A special image with the name
"\&.host"
refers to the image of the running host system\&. It hence conceptually maps to the special
"\&.host"
machine name described above\&. Note that
\fBmachinectl list\-images\fR
will not show this special image either, unless
\fB\-\-all\fR
is specified\&.
.SH "FILES AND DIRECTORIES"
.PP
Machine images are preferably stored in
/var/lib/machines/, but are also searched for in
/usr/local/lib/machines/
and
/usr/lib/machines/\&. For compatibility reasons, the directory
/var/lib/container/
is searched, too\&. Note that images stored below
/usr/
are always considered read\-only\&. It is possible to symlink machines images from other directories into
/var/lib/machines/
to make them available for control with
\fBmachinectl\fR\&.

\fI$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE\fR

Takes a boolean argument\&. When true, the "secure" mode of the pager is enabled; if false, disabled\&. If

\fBsd_pid_get_owner_uid\fR(3)\&. In secure mode,
\fBLESSSECURE=1\fR

\fI$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE\fR

Note: when commands are invoked with elevated privileges, for example under
