.SH "NAME"
systemd.netdev \- Virtual Network Device configuration
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fInetdev\fR\&.netdev
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
A plain ini\-style text file that encodes configuration about a virtual network device, used by
\fBsystemd-networkd\fR(8)\&. See
\fBsystemd.syntax\fR(7)
for a general description of the syntax\&.
.PP
The main Virtual Network Device file must have the extension
\&.netdev; other extensions are ignored\&. Virtual network devices are created as soon as networkd is started\&. If a netdev with the specified name already exists, networkd will use that as\-is rather than create its own\&. Note that the settings of the pre\-existing netdev will not be changed by networkd\&.
.PP
The
\&.netdev
files are read from the files located in the system network directory
/usr/lib/systemd/network, the volatile runtime network directory
/run/systemd/network
and the local administration network directory
/etc/systemd/network\&. All configuration files are collectively sorted and processed in lexical order, regardless of the directories in which they live\&. However, files with identical filenames replace each other\&. Files in
/etc/
have the highest priority, files in
/run/
take precedence over files with the same name in
/usr/lib/\&. This can be used to override a system\-supplied configuration file with a local file if needed\&. As a special case, an empty file (file size 0) or symlink with the same name pointing to
/dev/null
disables the configuration file entirely (it is "masked")\&.
.PP
Along with the netdev file
foo\&.netdev, a "drop\-in" directory
foo\&.netdev\&.d/
may exist\&. All files with the suffix
"\&.conf"
from this directory will be parsed after the file itself is parsed\&. This is useful to alter or add configuration settings, without having to modify the main configuration file\&. Each drop\-in file must have appropriate section headers\&.
.PP
In addition to
/etc/systemd/network, drop\-in
"\&.d"
directories can be placed in
/usr/lib/systemd/network
or
/run/systemd/network
directories\&. Drop\-in files in
/etc/
take precedence over those in
/run/
which in turn take precedence over those in
/usr/lib/\&. Drop\-in files under any of these directories take precedence over the main netdev file wherever located\&. (Of course, since
/run/
is temporary and
/usr/lib/
is for vendors, it is unlikely drop\-ins should be used in either of those places\&.)

.RE
.PP
\fIFailOverMACPolicy=\fR
.RS 4
Specifies whether the active\-backup mode should set all slaves to the same MAC address at the time of enslavement or, when enabled, to perform special handling of the bond\*(Aqs MAC address in accordance with the selected policy\&. The default policy is none\&. Possible values are
"none",
"active"
and
"follow"\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIARPValidate=\fR
.RS 4
Specifies whether or not ARP probes and replies should be validated in any mode that supports ARP monitoring, or whether non\-ARP traffic should be filtered (disregarded) for link monitoring purposes\&. Possible values are
"none",
"active",
"backup"
and
"all"\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIARPIntervalSec=\fR

.RE
.PP
\fIARPIPTargets=\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the IP addresses to use as ARP monitoring peers when ARPIntervalSec is greater than 0\&. These are the targets of the ARP request sent to determine the health of the link to the targets\&. Specify these values in IPv4 dotted decimal format\&. At least one IP address must be given for ARP monitoring to function\&. The maximum number of targets that can be specified is 16\&. The default value is no IP addresses\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIARPAllTargets=\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the quantity of ARPIPTargets that must be reachable in order for the ARP monitor to consider a slave as being up\&. This option affects only active\-backup mode for slaves with ARPValidate enabled\&. Possible values are
"any"
and
"all"\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIPrimaryReselectPolicy=\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the reselection policy for the primary slave\&. This affects how the primary slave is chosen to become the active slave when failure of the active slave or recovery of the primary slave occurs\&. This option is designed to prevent flip\-flopping between the primary slave and other slaves\&. Possible values are
"always",
"better"
and
"failure"\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIResendIGMP=\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the number of IGMP membership reports to be issued after a failover event\&. One membership report is issued immediately after the failover, subsequent packets are sent in each 200ms interval\&. The valid range is 0\(en255\&. Defaults to 1\&. A value of 0 prevents the IGMP membership report from being issued in response to the failover event\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIPacketsPerSlave=\fR
.RS 4
Specify the number of packets to transmit through a slave before moving to the next one\&. When set to 0, then a slave is chosen at random\&. The valid range is 0\(en65535\&. Defaults to 1\&. This option only has effect when in balance\-rr mode\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIGratuitousARP=\fR
.RS 4
Specify the number of peer notifications (gratuitous ARPs and unsolicited IPv6 Neighbor Advertisements) to be issued after a failover event\&. As soon as the link is up on the new slave, a peer notification is sent on the bonding device and each VLAN sub\-device\&. This is repeated at each link monitor interval (ARPIntervalSec or MIIMonitorSec, whichever is active) if the number is greater than 1\&. The valid range is 0\(en255\&. The default value is 1\&. These options affect only the active\-backup mode\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIAllSlavesActive=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean\&. Specifies that duplicate frames (received on inactive ports) should be dropped when false, or delivered when true\&. Normally, bonding will drop duplicate frames (received on inactive ports), which is desirable for most users\&. But there are some times it is nice to allow duplicate frames to be delivered\&. The default value is false (drop duplicate frames received on inactive ports)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIDynamicTransmitLoadBalancing=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean\&. Specifies if dynamic shuffling of flows is enabled\&. Applies only for balance\-tlb mode\&. Defaults to unset\&.

\fIGatewayMode=\fR
.RS 4
Takes one of
"off",
"server", or
"client"\&. A batman\-adv node can either run in server mode (sharing its internet connection with the mesh) or in client mode (searching for the most suitable internet connection in the mesh) or having the gateway support turned off entirely (which is the default setting)\&.

.RE
.PP
\fIHopPenalty=\fR
.RS 4
The hop penalty setting allows to modify
\fBbatctl\fR(8)
preference for multihop routes vs\&. short routes\&. This integer value is applied to the TQ (Transmit Quality) of each forwarded OGM (Originator Message), thereby propagating the cost of an extra hop (the packet has to be received and retransmitted which costs airtime)\&. A higher hop penalty will make it more unlikely that other nodes will choose this node as intermediate hop towards any given destination\&. The default hop penalty of \*(Aq15\*(Aq is a reasonable value for most setups and probably does not need to be changed\&. However, mobile nodes could choose a value of 255 (maximum value) to avoid being chosen as a router by other nodes\&. The minimum value is 0\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIOriginatorIntervalSec=\fR
.RS 4
The value specifies the interval in seconds, unless another time unit is specified in which batman\-adv floods the network with its protocol information\&. See
\fBsystemd.time\fR(7)

.RE
.PP
\fIGatewayBandwidthDown=\fR
.RS 4
If the node is a server, this parameter is used to inform other nodes in the network about this node\*(Aqs internet connection download bandwidth in bits per second\&. Just enter any number suffixed with K, M, G or T (base 1000) and the batman\-adv module will propagate the entered value in the mesh\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIGatewayBandwidthUp=\fR
.RS 4
If the node is a server, this parameter is used to inform other nodes in the network about this node\*(Aqs internet connection upload bandwidth in bits per second\&.
