.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
An nspawn container settings file (suffix
\&.nspawn) contains runtime configuration for a local container, and is used used by
\fBsystemd-nspawn\fR(1)\&. Files of this type are named after the containers they define settings for\&. They are optional, and only required for containers whose execution environment shall differ from the defaults\&. Files of this type mostly contain settings that may also be set on the
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR
command line, and make it easier to persistently attach specific settings to specific containers\&. The syntax of these files is inspired by
\&.desktop
files, similarly to other configuration files supported by the systemd project\&. See
\fBsystemd.syntax\fR(7)
for an overview\&.
.SH "\&.NSPAWN FILE DISCOVERY"
.PP
Files are searched for by appending the
\&.nspawn
suffix to the machine name of the container, as specified with the
\fB\-\-machine=\fR
switch of
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR, or derived from the directory or image file name\&. This file is first searched for in
/etc/systemd/nspawn/
and
/run/systemd/nspawn/\&. If found there, the settings are read and all of them take full effect (but may still be overridden by corresponding command line arguments)\&. Otherwise, the file will then be searched for next to the image file or in the immediate parent of the root directory of the container\&. If the file is found there, only a subset of the settings will take effect however\&. All settings that possibly elevate privileges or grant additional access to resources of the host (such as files or directories) are ignored\&. To which options this applies is documented below\&.
.PP
Persistent settings files created and maintained by the administrator (and thus trusted) should be placed in
/etc/systemd/nspawn/, while automatically downloaded (and thus potentially untrusted) settings files are placed in
/var/lib/machines/
instead (next to the container images), where their security impact is limited\&. In order to add privileged settings to
\&.nspawn
files acquired from the image vendor, it is recommended to copy the settings files into
/etc/systemd/nspawn/
and edit them there, so that the privileged options become available\&. The precise algorithm for how the files are searched and interpreted may be configured with
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR\*(Aqs
\fB\-\-settings=\fR
switch, see
\fBsystemd-nspawn\fR(1)
for details\&.
.SH "[EXEC] SECTION OPTIONS"
.PP
Settings files may include an [Exec] section, which carries various execution parameters:
.PP
\fIBoot=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean argument, which defaults to off\&. If enabled,
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR
will automatically search for an
init
executable and invoke it\&. In this case, the specified parameters using
\fIParameters=\fR
are passed as additional arguments to the
init
process\&. This setting corresponds to the
\fB\-\-boot\fR
switch on the
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR
command line\&. This option may not be combined with
\fIProcessTwo=yes\fR\&. This option is specified by default in the
systemd\-nspawn@\&.service
template unit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIEphemeral=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean argument, which defaults to off, If enabled, the container is run with a temporary snapshot of its file system that is removed immediately when the container terminates\&. This is equivalent to the
\fB\-\-ephemeral\fR
command line switch\&. See
\fBsystemd-nspawn\fR(1)
for details about the specific options supported\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIProcessTwo=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean argument, which defaults to off\&. If enabled, the specified program is run as PID 2\&. A stub init process is run as PID 1\&. This setting corresponds to the
\fB\-\-as\-pid2\fR
switch on the
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR
command line\&. This option may not be combined with
\fIBoot=yes\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIParameters=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a whitespace\-separated list of arguments\&. Single ("\*(Aq") and double (""") quotes may be used around arguments with whitespace\&. This is either a command line, beginning with the binary name to execute, or \(en if
\fIBoot=\fR
is enabled \(en the list of arguments to pass to the init process\&. This setting corresponds to the command line parameters passed on the
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR
command line\&.
.sp
Note:
\fBBoot=no\fR,
\fBParameters=a b "c c"\fR
is the same as
\fBsystemd\-nspawn a b "c c"\fR, and
\fBBoot=yes\fR,
\fBParameters=b \*(Aqc c\*(Aq\fR
is the same as
\fBsystemd\-nspawn \-\-boot b \*(Aqc c\*(Aq\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIEnvironment=\fR
.RS 4
Takes an environment variable assignment consisting of key and value, separated by
"="\&. Sets an environment variable for the main process invoked in the container\&. This setting may be used multiple times to set multiple environment variables\&. It corresponds to the
\fB\-\-setenv=\fR
command line switch\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIUser=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a UNIX user name\&. Specifies the user name to invoke the main process of the container as\&. This user must be known in the container\*(Aqs user database\&. This corresponds to the
\fB\-\-user=\fR
command line switch\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIWorkingDirectory=\fR
.RS 4
Selects the working directory for the process invoked in the container\&. Expects an absolute path in the container\*(Aqs file system namespace\&. This corresponds to the
\fB\-\-chdir=\fR
command line switch\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIPivotRoot=\fR
.RS 4
Selects a directory to pivot to
/
inside the container when starting up\&. Takes a single path, or a pair of two paths separated by a colon\&. Both paths must be absolute, and are resolved in the container\*(Aqs file system namespace\&. This corresponds to the
\fB\-\-pivot\-root=\fR
command line switch\&.
.RE
.PP
\fICapability=\fR, \fIDropCapability=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a space\-separated list of Linux process capabilities (see
\fBcapabilities\fR(7)
for details)\&. The
\fICapability=\fR
setting specifies additional capabilities to pass on top of the default set of capabilities\&. The
\fIDropCapability=\fR
setting specifies capabilities to drop from the default set\&. These settings correspond to the
\fB\-\-capability=\fR
and
\fB\-\-drop\-capability=\fR
command line switches\&. Note that
\fICapability=\fR
is a privileged setting, and only takes effect in
\&.nspawn
files in
/etc/systemd/nspawn/
and
/run/system/nspawn/
(see above)\&. On the other hand,
\fIDropCapability=\fR
takes effect in all cases\&. If the special value
"all"
is passed, all capabilities are retained (or dropped)\&.
.sp
These settings change the bounding set of capabilities which also limits the ambient capabilities as given with the
\fIAmbientCapability=\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIAmbientCapability=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a space\-separated list of Linux process capabilities (see
\fBcapabilities\fR(7)
for details)\&. The
\fIAmbientCapability=\fR
setting specifies capability which will be passed to to started program in the inheritable and ambient capability sets\&. This will grant these capabilities to this process\&. This setting correspond to the
\fB\-\-ambient\-capability=\fR
command line switch\&.
.sp
The value
"all"
is not supported for this setting\&.
.sp
The setting of
\fIAmbientCapability=\fR
must be covered by the bounding set settings which were established by
\fICapability=\fR
and
\fIDropCapability=\fR\&.
.sp
Note that
\fIAmbientCapability=\fR
is a privileged setting (see above)\&.
.RE
.PP

.PP
\fIBridge=\fR
.RS 4
