.SH "NAME"
systemd.network \- Network configuration
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fInetwork\fR\&.network
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
A plain ini\-style text file that encodes network configuration for matching network interfaces, used by
\fBsystemd-networkd\fR(8)\&. See
\fBsystemd.syntax\fR(7)
for a general description of the syntax\&.
.PP
The main network file must have the extension
\&.network; other extensions are ignored\&. Networks are applied to links whenever the links appear\&.
.PP
The
\&.network
files are read from the files located in the system network directories
/usr/lib/systemd/network
and
/usr/local/lib/systemd/network, the volatile runtime network directory
/run/systemd/network
and the local administration network directory
/etc/systemd/network\&. All configuration files are collectively sorted and processed in lexical order, regardless of the directories in which they live\&. However, files with identical filenames replace each other\&. Files in
/etc/
have the highest priority, files in
/run/
take precedence over files with the same name under
/usr/\&. This can be used to override a system\-supplied configuration file with a local file if needed\&. As a special case, an empty file (file size 0) or symlink with the same name pointing to
/dev/null
disables the configuration file entirely (it is "masked")\&.
.PP
Along with the network file
foo\&.network, a "drop\-in" directory
foo\&.network\&.d/
may exist\&. All files with the suffix
"\&.conf"
from this directory will be parsed after the file itself is parsed\&. This is useful to alter or add configuration settings, without having to modify the main configuration file\&. Each drop\-in file must have appropriate section headers\&.
.PP
In addition to
/etc/systemd/network, drop\-in
"\&.d"
directories can be placed in
/usr/lib/systemd/network
or
/run/systemd/network
directories\&. Drop\-in files in
/etc/
take precedence over those in
/run/
which in turn take precedence over those in
/usr/lib/\&. Drop\-in files under any of these directories take precedence over the main network file wherever located\&.
.SH "[MATCH] SECTION OPTIONS"
.PP
The network file contains a [Match] section, which determines if a given network file may be applied to a given device; and a [Network] section specifying how the device should be configured\&. The first (in lexical order) of the network files that matches a given device is applied, all later files are ignored, even if they match as well\&.
.PP
A network file is said to match a network interface if all matches specified by the [Match] section are satisfied\&. When a network file does not contain valid settings in [Match] section, then the file will match all interfaces and
\fBsystemd\-networkd\fR
warns about that\&. Hint: to avoid the warning and to make it clear that all interfaces shall be matched, add the following:

\fIMTUBytes=\fR
.RS 4
The maximum transmission unit in bytes to set for the device\&. The usual suffixes K, M, G, are supported and are understood to the base of 1024\&.
.sp
Note that if IPv6 is enabled on the interface, and the MTU is chosen below 1280 (the minimum MTU for IPv6) it will automatically be increased to this value\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIARP=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean\&. If set to true, the ARP (low\-level Address Resolution Protocol) for this interface is enabled\&. When unset, the kernel\*(Aqs default will be used\&.
.sp
For example, disabling ARP is useful when creating multiple MACVLAN or VLAN virtual interfaces atop a single lower\-level physical interface, which will then only serve as a link/"bridge" device aggregating traffic to the same physical link and not participate in the network otherwise\&. Defaults to unset\&.
.RE

.RS 4
Takes a boolean\&. If set to true, the multicast flag on the device is enabled\&. Defaults to unset\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIAllMulticast=\fR

Takes a boolean\&. If set to true, the driver retrieves all multicast packets from the network\&. This happens when multicast routing is enabled\&. Defaults to unset\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIPromiscuous=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean\&. If set to true, promiscuous mode of the interface is enabled\&. Defaults to unset\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIUnmanaged=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean\&. When
"yes", no attempts are made to bring up or configure matching links, equivalent to when there are no matching network files\&. Defaults to
"no"\&.
.sp
This is useful for preventing later matching network files from interfering with certain interfaces that are fully controlled by other applications\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIGroup=\fR
.RS 4
Link groups are similar to port ranges found in managed switches\&. When network interfaces are added to a numbered group, operations on all the interfaces from that group can be performed at once\&. An unsigned integer in the range 0\&...4294967294\&. Defaults to unset\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIRequiredForOnline=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean or a minimum operational state and an optional maximum operational state\&. Please see
\fBnetworkctl\fR(1)
for possible operational states\&. When
"yes", the network is deemed required when determining whether the system is online when running
\fBsystemd\-networkd\-wait\-online\fR\&. When
"no", the network is ignored when checking for online state\&. When a minimum operational state and an optional maximum operational state are set,
"yes"
is implied, and this controls the minimum and maximum operational state required for the network interface to be considered online\&. Defaults to
"yes"\&.
.sp
The network will be brought up normally in all cases, but in the event that there is no address being assigned by DHCP or the cable is not plugged in, the link will simply remain offline and be skipped automatically by
\fBsystemd\-networkd\-wait\-online\fR
if
"RequiredForOnline=no"\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIActivationPolicy=\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the policy for
\fBsystemd\-networkd\fR
managing the link administrative state\&. Specifically, this controls how
\fBsystemd\-networkd\fR
changes the network device\*(Aqs
"IFF_UP"
flag, which is sometimes controlled by system administrators by running e\&.g\&.,
\fBip set dev eth0 up\fR
or
\fBip set dev eth0 down\fR, and can also be changed with
\fBnetworkctl up eth0\fR
or
\fBnetworkctl down eth0\fR\&.
.sp
Takes one of
"up",
"always\-up",
"manual",
"always\-down",
"down", or
"bound"\&. When
"manual",
\fBsystemd\-networkd\fR
will not change the link\*(Aqs admin state automatically; the system administrator must bring the interface up or down manually, as desired\&. When
"up"
(the default) or
"always\-up", or
"down"
or
"always\-down",
\fBsystemd\-networkd\fR
will set the link up or down, respectively, when the interface is (re)configured\&. When
"always\-up"
or
"always\-down",
\fBsystemd\-networkd\fR
will set the link up or down, respectively, any time
\fBsystemd\-networkd\fR
detects a change in the administrative state\&. When
\fIBindCarrier=\fR
is also set, this is automatically set to
"bound"
and any other value is ignored\&.
.sp
The administrative state is not the same as the carrier state, so using
"always\-up"
does not mean the link will never lose carrier\&. The link carrier depends on both the administrative state as well as the network device\*(Aqs physical connection\&. However, to avoid reconfiguration failures, when using
"always\-up",
\fIIgnoreCarrierLoss=\fR
is forced to true\&.
.RE
.SH "[SR\-IOV] SECTION OPTIONS"
.PP
The [SR\-IOV] section accepts the following keys\&. Specify several [SR\-IOV] sections to configure several SR\-IOVs\&. SR\-IOV provides the ability to partition a single physical PCI resource into virtual PCI functions which can then be injected into a VM\&. In the case of network VFs, SR\-IOV improves north\-south network performance (that is, traffic with endpoints outside the host machine) by allowing traffic to bypass the host machine\(cqs network stack\&.
.PP

.sp
Note that DHCPv6 will by default be triggered by Router Advertisement, if that is enabled, regardless of this parameter\&. By enabling DHCPv6 support explicitly, the DHCPv6 client will be started regardless of the presence of routers on the link, or what flags the routers pass\&. See

.RE
.PP
\fIIPv6Token=\fR
.RS 4
Specifies an optional address generation mode for the Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)\&. Supported modes are
"prefixstable"
and
"static"\&.
.sp
When the mode is set to
"static", an IPv6 address must be specified after a colon (":"), and the lower bits of the supplied address are combined with the upper bits of a prefix received in a Router Advertisement (RA) message to form a complete address\&. Note that if multiple prefixes are received in an RA message, or in multiple RA messages, addresses will be formed from each of them using the supplied address\&. This mode implements SLAAC but uses a static interface identifier instead of an identifier generated by using the EUI\-64 algorithm\&. Because the interface identifier is static, if Duplicate Address Detection detects that the computed address is a duplicate (in use by another node on the link), then this mode will fail to provide an address for that prefix\&. If an IPv6 address without mode is specified, then
"static"
mode is assumed\&.
.sp
When the mode is set to
"prefixstable"
the
\m[blue]\fBRFC 7217\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
algorithm for generating interface identifiers will be used\&. This mode can optionally take an IPv6 address separated with a colon (":")\&. If an IPv6 address is specified, then an interface identifier is generated only when a prefix received in an RA message matches the supplied address\&.
.sp
If no address generation mode is specified (which is the default), or a received prefix does not match any of the addresses provided in
"prefixstable"
mode, then the EUI\-64 algorithm will be used to form an interface identifier for that prefix\&. This mode is also SLAAC, but with a potentially stable interface identifier which does not directly map to the interface\*(Aqs hardware address\&.
.sp
Note that the
"prefixstable"
algorithm uses both the interface name and MAC address as input to the hash to compute the interface identifier, so if either of those are changed the resulting interface identifier (and address) will change, even if the prefix received in the RA message has not changed\&.
.sp
This setting can be specified multiple times\&. If an empty string is assigned, then the all previous assignments are cleared\&.

.RS 4
Controls support for Ethernet LLDP packet emission\&. Accepts a boolean parameter or the special values
"nearest\-bridge",
"non\-tpmr\-bridge"
and
"customer\-bridge"\&. Defaults to false, which turns off LLDP packet emission\&. If not false, a short LLDP packet with information about the local system is sent out in regular intervals on the link\&. The LLDP packet will contain information about the local hostname, the local machine ID (as stored in
\fBmachine-id\fR(5)) and the local interface name, as well as the pretty hostname of the system (as set in
\fBmachine-info\fR(5))\&. LLDP emission is only available on Ethernet links\&. Note that this setting passes data suitable for identification of host to the network and should thus not be enabled on untrusted networks, where such identification data should not be made available\&. Use this option to permit other systems to identify on which interfaces they are connected to this system\&. The three special values control propagation of the LLDP packets\&. The
"nearest\-bridge"
setting permits propagation only to the nearest connected bridge,
"non\-tpmr\-bridge"
permits propagation across Two\-Port MAC Relays, but not any other bridges, and
"customer\-bridge"
permits propagation until a customer bridge is reached\&. For details about these concepts, see
\m[blue]\fBIEEE 802\&.1AB\-2016\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[6]\d\s+2\&. Note that configuring this setting to true is equivalent to

.RS 4
A static IPv4 or IPv6 address and its prefix length, separated by a

\fBinet_pton\fR(3)\&. This is a short\-hand for an [Address] section only containing an Address key (see below)\&. This option may be specified more than once\&.
.sp
If the specified address is
"0\&.0\&.0\&.0"
(for IPv4) or
"::"
(for IPv6), a new address range of the requested size is automatically allocated from a system\-wide pool of unused ranges\&. Note that the prefix length must be equal or larger than 8 for IPv4, and 64 for IPv6\&. The allocated range is checked against all current network interfaces and all known network configuration files to avoid address range conflicts\&. The default system\-wide pool consists of 192\&.168\&.0\&.0/16, 172\&.16\&.0\&.0/12 and 10\&.0\&.0\&.0/8 for IPv4, and fd00::/8 for IPv6\&. This functionality is useful to manage a large number of dynamically created network interfaces with the same network configuration and automatic address range assignment\&.

\fIDomains=\fR
.RS 4
A whitespace\-separated list of domains which should be resolved using the DNS servers on this link\&. Each item in the list should be a domain name, optionally prefixed with a tilde ("~")\&. The domains with the prefix are called "routing\-only domains"\&. The domains without the prefix are called "search domains" and are first used as search suffixes for extending single\-label hostnames (hostnames containing no dots) to become fully qualified domain names (FQDNs)\&. If a single\-label hostname is resolved on this interface, each of the specified search domains are appended to it in turn, converting it into a fully qualified domain name, until one of them may be successfully resolved\&.
.sp
Both "search" and "routing\-only" domains are used for routing of DNS queries: look\-ups for hostnames ending in those domains (hence also single label names, if any "search domains" are listed), are routed to the DNS servers configured for this interface\&. The domain routing logic is particularly useful on multi\-homed hosts with DNS servers serving particular private DNS zones on each interface\&.
.sp
The "routing\-only" domain
"~\&."
(the tilde indicating definition of a routing domain, the dot referring to the DNS root domain which is the implied suffix of all valid DNS names) has special effect\&. It causes all DNS traffic which does not match another configured domain routing entry to be routed to DNS servers specified for this interface\&. This setting is useful to prefer a certain set of DNS servers if a link on which they are connected is available\&.

\fBsystemd-resolved.service\fR(8)\&. "Search domains" correspond to the
\fIdomain\fR

When RAs are accepted, they may trigger the start of the DHCPv6 client if the relevant flags are set in the RA data, or if no routers are found on the link\&. The default is to disable RA reception for bridge devices or when IP forwarding is enabled, and to enable it otherwise\&.
