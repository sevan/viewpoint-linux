.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBsystemd\-mount\fR
may be used to create and start a transient
\&.mount
or
\&.automount
unit of the file system
\fIWHAT\fR
on the mount point
\fIWHERE\fR\&.
.PP
In many ways,
\fBsystemd\-mount\fR
is similar to the lower\-level
\fBmount\fR(8)
command, however instead of executing the mount operation directly and immediately,
\fBsystemd\-mount\fR
schedules it through the service manager job queue, so that it may pull in further dependencies (such as parent mounts, or a file system checker to execute a priori), and may make use of the auto\-mounting logic\&.
.PP
The command takes either one or two arguments\&. If only one argument is specified it should refer to a block device or regular file containing a file system (e\&.g\&.
"/dev/sdb1"
or
"/path/to/disk\&.img")\&. The block device or image file is then probed for a file system label and other metadata, and is mounted to a directory below
/run/media/system/
whose name is generated from the file system label\&. In this mode the block device or image file must exist at the time of invocation of the command, so that it may be probed\&. If the device is found to be a removable block device (e\&.g\&. a USB stick), an automount point is created instead of a regular mount point (i\&.e\&. the
\fB\-\-automount=\fR
option is implied, see below)\&.
.PP
If two arguments are specified, the first indicates the mount source (the
\fIWHAT\fR) and the second indicates the path to mount it on (the
\fIWHERE\fR)\&. In this mode no probing of the source is attempted, and a backing device node doesn\*(Aqt have to exist\&. However, if this mode is combined with
\fB\-\-discover\fR, device node probing for additional metadata is enabled, and \(en much like in the single\-argument case discussed above \(en the specified device has to exist at the time of invocation of the command\&.
.PP
Use the
\fB\-\-list\fR
command to show a terse table of all local, known block devices with file systems that may be mounted with this command\&.
.PP
\fBsystemd\-umount\fR
can be used to unmount a mount or automount point\&. It is the same as
\fBsystemd\-mount\fR
\fB\-\-umount\fR\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The following options are understood:
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-block\fR
.RS 4
Do not synchronously wait for the requested operation to finish\&. If this is not specified, the job will be verified, enqueued and
\fBsystemd\-mount\fR
will wait until the mount or automount unit\*(Aqs start\-up is completed\&. By passing this argument, it is only verified and enqueued\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-full\fR
.RS 4
Do not ellipsize the output when
\fB\-\-list\fR
is specified\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-pager\fR
.RS 4
Do not pipe output into a pager\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-legend\fR
.RS 4
Do not print the legend, i\&.e\&. column headers and the footer with hints\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-ask\-password\fR
.RS 4
Do not query the user for authentication for privileged operations\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-quiet\fR, \fB\-q\fR
.RS 4
Suppresses additional informational output while running\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-discover\fR
.RS 4
Enable probing of the mount source\&. This switch is implied if a single argument is specified on the command line\&. If passed, additional metadata is read from the device to enhance the unit to create\&. For example, a descriptive string for the transient units is generated from the file system label and device model\&. Moreover if a removable block device (e\&.g\&. USB stick) is detected an automount unit instead of a regular mount unit is created, with a short idle timeout, in order to ensure the file\-system is placed in a clean state quickly after each access\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-type=\fR, \fB\-t\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the file system type to mount (e\&.g\&.
"vfat"
or
"ext4")\&. If omitted or set to
"auto", the file system type is determined automatically\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-options=\fR, \fB\-o\fR
.RS 4
Additional mount options for the mount point\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-owner=\fR\fB\fIUSER\fR\fR
.RS 4
Let the specified user
\fIUSER\fR
own the mounted file system\&. This is done by appending
\fBuid=\fR
and
\fBgid=\fR
options to the list of mount options\&. Only certain file systems support this option\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-fsck=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean argument, defaults to on\&. Controls whether to run a file system check immediately before the mount operation\&. In the automount case (see
\fB\-\-automount=\fR
below) the check will be run the moment the first access to the device is made, which might slightly delay the access\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-description=\fR
.RS 4
Provide a description for the mount or automount unit\&. See
\fIDescription=\fR
in
\fBsystemd.unit\fR(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-property=\fR, \fB\-p\fR
.RS 4
Sets a unit property for the mount unit that is created\&. This takes an assignment in the same format as
\fBsystemctl\fR(1)\*(Aqs
\fBset\-property\fR
command\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-automount=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a boolean argument\&. Controls whether to create an automount point or a regular mount point\&. If true an automount point is created that is backed by the actual file system at the time of first access\&. If false a plain mount point is created that is backed by the actual file system immediately\&. Automount points have the benefit that the file system stays unmounted and hence in clean state until it is first accessed\&. In automount mode the
\fB\-\-timeout\-idle\-sec=\fR
switch (see below) may be used to ensure the mount point is unmounted automatically after the last access and an idle period passed\&.
.sp
If this switch is not specified it defaults to false\&. If not specified and
\fB\-\-discover\fR
is used (or only a single argument passed, which implies
\fB\-\-discover\fR, see above), and the file system block device is detected to be removable, it is set to true, in order to increase the chance that the file system is in a fully clean state if the device is unplugged abruptly\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-A\fR
.RS 4
Equivalent to
\fB\-\-automount=yes\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-timeout\-idle\-sec=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a time value that controls the idle timeout in automount mode\&. If set to
"infinity"
(the default) no automatic unmounts are done\&. Otherwise the file system backing the automount point is detached after the last access and the idle timeout passed\&. See
\fBsystemd.time\fR(7)
for details on the time syntax supported\&. This option has no effect if only a regular mount is established, and automounting is not used\&.
.sp
Note that if
\fB\-\-discover\fR
is used (or only a single argument passed, which implies
\fB\-\-discover\fR, see above), and the file system block device is detected to be removable,
\fB\-\-timeout\-idle\-sec=1s\fR
is implied\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-automount\-property=\fR
.RS 4
Similar to
\fB\-\-property=\fR, but applies additional properties to the automount unit created, instead of the mount unit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-bind\-device\fR
.RS 4
This option only has an effect in automount mode, and controls whether the automount unit shall be bound to the backing device\*(Aqs lifetime\&. If set, the automount point will be removed automatically when the backing device vanishes\&. By default the automount point stays around, and subsequent accesses will block until backing device is replugged\&. This option has no effect in case of non\-device mounts, such as network or virtual file system mounts\&.
.sp
Note that if
\fB\-\-discover\fR
is used (or only a single argument passed, which implies
\fB\-\-discover\fR, see above), and the file system block device is detected to be removable, this option is implied\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-list\fR
.RS 4
Instead of establishing a mount or automount point, print a terse list of block devices containing file systems that may be mounted with
"systemd\-mount", along with useful metadata such as labels, etc\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-umount\fR
.RS 4
Stop the mount and automount units corresponding to the specified mount points
\fIWHERE\fR
or the devices
\fIWHAT\fR\&.
\fBsystemd\-mount\fR
with this option or
\fBsystemd\-umount\fR
can take multiple arguments which can be mount points, devices,
/etc/fstab
style node names, or backing files corresponding to loop devices, like
\fBsystemd\-mount \-\-umount /path/to/umount /dev/sda1 UUID=xxxxxx\-xxxx LABEL=xxxxx /path/to/disk\&.img\fR\&. Note that when
\fB\-H\fR
or
\fB\-M\fR
is specified, only absolute paths to mount points are supported\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-G\fR, \fB\-\-collect\fR
.RS 4
Unload the transient unit after it completed, even if it failed\&. Normally, without this option, all mount units that mount and failed are kept in memory until the user explicitly resets their failure state with
\fBsystemctl reset\-failed\fR
or an equivalent command\&. On the other hand, units that stopped successfully are unloaded immediately\&. If this option is turned on the "garbage collection" of units is more aggressive, and unloads units regardless if they exited successfully or failed\&. This option is a shortcut for
\fB\-\-property=CollectMode=inactive\-or\-failed\fR, see the explanation for
\fICollectMode=\fR
in
\fBsystemd.unit\fR(5)
for further information\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-user\fR
.RS 4
Talk to the service manager of the calling user, rather than the service manager of the system\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-system\fR
.RS 4
Talk to the service manager of the system\&. This is the implied default\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-host=\fR
.RS 4
Execute the operation remotely\&. Specify a hostname, or a username and hostname separated by
"@", to connect to\&. The hostname may optionally be suffixed by a port ssh is listening on, separated by
":", and then a container name, separated by
"/", which connects directly to a specific container on the specified host\&. This will use SSH to talk to the remote machine manager instance\&. Container names may be enumerated with
\fBmachinectl \-H \fR\fB\fIHOST\fR\fR\&. Put IPv6 addresses in brackets\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-machine=\fR
.RS 4
Execute operation on a local container\&. Specify a container name to connect to, optionally prefixed by a user name to connect as and a separating
"@"
character\&. If the special string
"\&.host"
is used in place of the container name, a connection to the local system is made (which is useful to connect to a specific user\*(Aqs user bus:
"\-\-user \-\-machine=lennart@\&.host")\&. If the
"@"
syntax is not used, the connection is made as root user\&. If the
"@"
syntax is used either the left hand side or the right hand side may be omitted (but not both) in which case the local user name and
"\&.host"
are implied\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Print a short help text and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-version\fR
.RS 4
Print a short version string and exit\&.
.RE
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.PP
On success, 0 is returned, a non\-zero failure code otherwise\&.
.SH "THE UDEV DATABASE"
.PP
If
\fB\-\-discover\fR
is used,
\fBsystemd\-mount\fR
honors a couple of additional udev properties of block devices:
.PP
\fISYSTEMD_MOUNT_OPTIONS=\fR
.RS 4
The mount options to use, if
\fB\-\-options=\fR
is not used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fISYSTEMD_MOUNT_WHERE=\fR
.RS 4
The file system path to place the mount point at, instead of the automatically generated one\&.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.PP
Use a udev rule like the following to automatically mount all USB storage plugged in:
.sp
