.SH "NAME"
resolvectl, resolvconf \- Resolve domain names, IPV4 and IPv6 addresses, DNS resource records, and services; introspect and reconfigure the DNS resolver
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

\fBresolvectl\fR [OPTIONS...] {COMMAND} [NAME...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBresolvectl\fR
may be used to resolve domain names, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, DNS resource records and services with the
\fBsystemd-resolved.service\fR(8)
resolver service\&. By default, the specified list of parameters will be resolved as hostnames, retrieving their IPv4 and IPv6 addresses\&. If the parameters specified are formatted as IPv4 or IPv6 operation the reverse operation is done, and a hostname is retrieved for the specified addresses\&.
.PP
The program\*(Aqs output contains information about the protocol used for the look\-up and on which network interface the data was discovered\&. It also contains information on whether the information could be authenticated\&. All data for which local DNSSEC validation succeeds is considered authenticated\&. Moreover all data originating from local, trusted sources is also reported authenticated, including resolution of the local host name, the
"localhost"
hostname or all data from
/etc/hosts\&.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.PP
\fBquery\fR \fIHOSTNAME|ADDRESS\fR\&...
.RS 4
Resolve domain names, as well as IPv4 and IPv6 addresses\&. When used in conjunction with
\fB\-\-type=\fR
or
\fB\-\-class=\fR
(see below), resolves low\-level DNS resource records\&.
.sp
If a single\-label domain name is specified it is searched for according to the configured search domains \(em unless
\fB\-\-search=no\fR
or
\fB\-\-type=\fR/\fB\-\-class=\fR
are specified, both of which turn this logic off\&.
.sp
If an international domain name is specified, it is automatically translated according to IDNA rules when resolved via classic DNS \(em but not for look\-ups via MulticastDNS or LLMNR\&. If
\fB\-\-type=\fR/\fB\-\-class=\fR
is used IDNA translation is turned off and domain names are processed as specified\&.

\m[blue]\fBSRV\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2
services, depending on the specified list of parameters\&. If three parameters are passed the first is assumed to be the DNS\-SD service name, the second the SRV service type, and the third the domain to search in\&. In this case a full DNS\-SD style SRV and TXT lookup is executed\&. If only two parameters are specified, the first is assumed to be the SRV service type, and the second the domain to look in\&. In this case no TXT RR is requested\&. Finally, if only one parameter is specified, it is assumed to be a domain name, that is already prefixed with an SRV type, and an SRV lookup is done (no TXT)\&.

.RS 4
Get/set per\-interface DNS configuration\&. These commands may be used to configure various DNS settings for network interfaces\&. These commands may be used to inform
\fBsystemd\-resolved\fR
or
\fBsystemd\-networkd\fR
about per\-interface DNS configuration determined through external means\&. The
\fBdns\fR
command expects IPv4 or IPv6 address specifications of DNS servers to use\&. Each address can optionally take a port number separated with
":", a network interface name or index separated with
"%", and a Server Name Indication (SNI) separated with
"#"\&. When IPv6 address is specified with a port number, then the address must be in the square brackets\&. That is, the acceptable full formats are
"111\&.222\&.333\&.444:9953%ifname#example\&.com"
for IPv4 and
"[1111:2222::3333]:9953%ifname#example\&.com"
for IPv6\&. The
\fBdomain\fR
command expects valid DNS domains, possibly prefixed with
"~", and configures a per\-interface search or route\-only domain\&. The
\fBdefault\-route\fR
command expects a boolean parameter, and configures whether the link may be used as default route for DNS lookups, i\&.e\&. if it is suitable for lookups on domains no other link explicitly is configured for\&. The
\fBllmnr\fR,
\fBmdns\fR,
\fBdnssec\fR
and
\fBdnsovertls\fR
commands may be used to configure the per\-interface LLMNR, MulticastDNS, DNSSEC and DNSOverTLS settings\&. Finally,
\fBnta\fR
command may be used to configure additional per\-interface DNSSEC NTA domains\&.
.sp
Commands
\fBdns\fR,
\fBdomain\fR
and
\fBnta\fR
can take a single empty string argument to clear their respective value lists\&.

\fBmdns\fR,

Specifies the network interface to execute the query on\&. This may either be specified as numeric interface index or as network interface string (e\&.g\&.
"en0")\&. Note that this option has no effect if system\-wide DNS configuration (as configured in
/etc/resolv\&.conf
or

.RE
.PP
\fB\-p\fR \fIPROTOCOL\fR, \fB\-\-protocol=\fR\fIPROTOCOL\fR

Specifies the network protocol for the query\&. May be one of

"llmnr"
(\m[blue]\fBLink\-Local Multicast Name Resolution\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[5]\d\s+2),

(\m[blue]\fBMulticast DNS\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[6]\d\s+2),
"mdns\-ipv4",
"mdns\-ipv6"
(MDNS via the indicated underlying IP protocols)\&. By default the lookup is done via all protocols suitable for the lookup\&. If used, limits the set of protocols that may be used\&. Use this option multiple times to enable resolving via multiple protocols at the same time\&. The setting
"llmnr"
is identical to specifying this switch once with
"llmnr\-ipv4"
and once via
"llmnr\-ipv6"\&. Note that this option does not force the service to resolve the operation with the specified protocol, as that might require a suitable network interface and configuration\&. The special value
"help"
may be used to list known values\&.

\fB\-t\fR \fITYPE\fR, \fB\-\-type=\fR\fITYPE\fR, \fB\-c\fR \fICLASS\fR, \fB\-\-class=\fR\fICLASS\fR

When used in conjunction with the
\fBquery\fR
command, specifies the DNS resource record type (e\&.g\&. A, AAAA, MX, \&...) and class (e\&.g\&. IN, ANY, \&...) to look up\&. If these options are used a DNS resource record set matching the specified class and type is requested\&. The class defaults to IN if only a type is specified\&. The special value
"help"
may be used to list known values\&.
.sp
Without these options
\fBresolvectl query\fR
provides high\-level domain name to address and address to domain name resolution\&. With these options it provides low\-level DNS resource record resolution\&. The search domain logic is automatically turned off when these options are used, i\&.e\&. specified domain names need to be fully qualified domain names\&. Moreover, IDNA internal domain name translation is turned off as well, i\&.e\&. international domain names should be specified in
"xn\-\-\&..."
notation, unless look\-up in MulticastDNS/LLMNR is desired, in which case UTF\-8 characters should be used\&.

\fB\-\-validate=\fR\fIBOOL\fR

systemd\-resolved\&.service
as a whole\&. If false, DNSSEC validation is disabled for the specific query, regardless of whether it is enabled for the network or in the service\&. Note that setting this option to true does not force DNSSEC validation on systems/networks where DNSSEC is turned off\&. This option is only suitable to turn off such validation where otherwise enabled, not enable validation where otherwise disabled\&.

.RE

\fB\-\-network=\fR\fIBOOL\fR

\fBresolvectl\fR

"resolvconf"
(generally achieved by means of a symbolic link of this name to the
\fBresolvectl\fR
binary) it is run in a limited
\fBresolvconf\fR(8)

commands operate\&. Note that
\fBsystemd\-resolved\&.service\fR
