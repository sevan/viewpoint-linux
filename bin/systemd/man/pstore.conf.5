.SH "NAME"
pstore.conf, pstore.conf.d \- PStore configuration file
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
/etc/systemd/pstore\&.conf
/etc/systemd/pstore\&.conf\&.d/*
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This file configures the behavior of
\fBsystemd-pstore\fR(8), a tool for archiving the contents of the persistent storage filesystem,
\m[blue]\fBpstore\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE"
.PP
The default configuration is set during compilation, so configuration is only needed when it is necessary to deviate from those defaults\&. Initially, the main configuration file in
/etc/systemd/
contains commented out entries showing the defaults as a guide to the administrator\&. Local overrides can be created by editing this file or by creating drop\-ins, as described below\&. Using drop\-ins for local configuration is recommended over modifications to the main configuration file\&.
.PP
In addition to the "main" configuration file, drop\-in configuration snippets are read from
/usr/lib/systemd/*\&.conf\&.d/,
/usr/local/lib/systemd/*\&.conf\&.d/, and
/etc/systemd/*\&.conf\&.d/\&. Those drop\-ins have higher precedence and override the main configuration file\&. Files in the
*\&.conf\&.d/
configuration subdirectories are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in which of the subdirectories they reside\&. When multiple files specify the same option, for options which accept just a single value, the entry in the file sorted last takes precedence, and for options which accept a list of values, entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files\&.
.PP
When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install drop\-ins under
/usr/\&. Files in
/etc/
are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration files installed by vendor packages\&. Drop\-ins have to be used to override package drop\-ins, since the main configuration file has lower precedence\&. It is recommended to prefix all filenames in those subdirectories with a two\-digit number and a dash, to simplify the ordering of the files\&.
.PP
To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to
/dev/null
in the configuration directory in
/etc/, with the same filename as the vendor configuration file\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
All options are configured in the [PStore] section:
.PP
\fIStorage=\fR
.RS 4
Controls where to archive (i\&.e\&. copy) files from the pstore filesystem\&. One of
"none",
"external", and
"journal"\&. When
"none", the tool exits without processing files in the pstore filesystem\&. When
"external"
(the default), files are archived into
/var/lib/systemd/pstore/, and logged into the journal\&. When
"journal", pstore file contents are logged only in the journal\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIUnlink=\fR
.RS 4
Controls whether or not files are removed from pstore after processing\&. Takes a boolean value\&. When true, a pstore file is removed from the pstore once it has been archived (either to disk or into the journal)\&. When false, processing of pstore files occurs normally, but the files remain in the pstore\&. The default is true in order to maintain the pstore in a nearly empty state, so that the pstore has storage available for the next kernel error event\&.
.RE
.PP
The defaults for all values are listed as comments in the template
/etc/systemd/pstore\&.conf
file that is installed by default\&.
