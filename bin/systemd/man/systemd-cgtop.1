.SH "NAME"
systemd-cgtop \- Show top control groups by their resource usage
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBsystemd\-cgtop\fR\ 'u
\fBsystemd\-cgtop\fR [OPTIONS...] [GROUP]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBsystemd\-cgtop\fR
shows the top control groups of the local Linux control group hierarchy, ordered by their CPU, memory, or disk I/O load\&. The display is refreshed in regular intervals (by default every 1s), similar in style to
\fBtop\fR(1)\&. If a control group path is specified, shows only the services of the specified control group\&.
.PP
If
\fBsystemd\-cgtop\fR
is not connected to a tty, no column headers are printed and the default is to only run one iteration\&. The
\fB\-\-iterations=\fR
argument, if given, is honored\&. This mode is suitable for scripting\&.
.PP
Resource usage is only accounted for control groups in the relevant hierarchy, i\&.e\&. CPU usage is only accounted for control groups in the
"cpuacct"
hierarchy, memory usage only for those in
"memory"
and disk I/O usage for those in
"blkio"\&. If resource monitoring for these resources is required, it is recommended to add the
\fICPUAccounting=1\fR,
\fIMemoryAccounting=1\fR
and
\fIBlockIOAccounting=1\fR
settings in the unit files in question\&. See
\fBsystemd.resource-control\fR(5)
for details\&.
.PP
The CPU load value can be between 0 and 100 times the number of processors the system has\&. For example, if the system has 8 processors, the CPU load value is going to be between 0% and 800%\&. The number of processors can be found in
"/proc/cpuinfo"\&.
.PP
To emphasize this: unless
"CPUAccounting=1",
"MemoryAccounting=1"
and
"BlockIOAccounting=1"
are enabled for the services in question, no resource accounting will be available for system services and the data shown by
\fBsystemd\-cgtop\fR
will be incomplete\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The following options are understood:
.PP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-order=path\fR
.RS 4
Order by control group path name\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-order=tasks\fR
.RS 4
Order by number of tasks/processes in the control group\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-order=cpu\fR
.RS 4
Order by CPU load\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-order=memory\fR
.RS 4
Order by memory usage\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-order=io\fR
.RS 4
Order by disk I/O load\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-batch\fR
.RS 4
Run in "batch" mode: do not accept input and run until the iteration limit set with
\fB\-\-iterations=\fR
is exhausted or until killed\&. This mode could be useful for sending output from
\fBsystemd\-cgtop\fR
to other programs or to a file\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-raw\fR
.RS 4
Format byte counts (as in memory usage and I/O metrics) and CPU time with raw numeric values rather than human\-readable numbers\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-cpu=percentage\fR, \fB\-\-cpu=time\fR
.RS 4
Controls whether the CPU usage is shown as percentage or time\&. By default, the CPU usage is shown as percentage\&. This setting may also be toggled at runtime by pressing the
%
key\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-P\fR
.RS 4
Count only userspace processes instead of all tasks\&. By default, all tasks are counted: each kernel thread and each userspace thread individually\&. With this setting, kernel threads are excluded from the counting and each userspace process only counts as one, regardless how many threads it consists of\&. This setting may also be toggled at runtime by pressing the
P
key\&. This option may not be combined with
\fB\-k\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-k\fR
.RS 4
Count only userspace processes and kernel threads instead of all tasks\&. By default, all tasks are counted: each kernel thread and each userspace thread individually\&. With this setting, kernel threads are included in the counting and each userspace process only counts as on one, regardless how many threads it consists of\&. This setting may also be toggled at runtime by pressing the
k
key\&. This option may not be combined with
\fB\-P\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-recursive=\fR
.RS 4
Controls whether the number of processes shown for a control group shall include all processes that are contained in any of the child control groups as well\&. Takes a boolean argument, which defaults to
"yes"\&. If enabled, the processes in child control groups are included, if disabled, only the processes in the control group itself are counted\&. This setting may also be toggled at runtime by pressing the
r
key\&. Note that this setting only applies to process counting, i\&.e\&. when the
\fB\-P\fR
or
\fB\-k\fR
options are used\&. It has not effect if all tasks are counted, in which case the counting is always recursive\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-iterations=\fR
.RS 4
Perform only this many iterations\&. A value of 0 indicates that the program should run indefinitely\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-1\fR
.RS 4
A shortcut for
\fB\-\-iterations=1\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-delay=\fR
.RS 4
Specify refresh delay in seconds (or if one of
"ms",
"us",
"min"
is specified as unit in this time unit)\&. This setting may also be increased and decreased at runtime by pressing the
+
and
\-
keys\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-depth=\fR
.RS 4
Maximum control group tree traversal depth\&. Specifies how deep
\fBsystemd\-cgtop\fR
shall traverse the control group hierarchies\&. If 0 is specified, only the root group is monitored\&. For 1, only the first level of control groups is monitored, and so on\&. Defaults to 3\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-M \fR\fB\fIMACHINE\fR\fR, \fB\-\-machine=\fR\fB\fIMACHINE\fR\fR
.RS 4
Limit control groups shown to the part corresponding to the container
\fIMACHINE\fR\&. This option may not be used when a control group path is specified\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Print a short help text and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-version\fR
.RS 4
Print a short version string and exit\&.
.RE
.SH "KEYS"

.RE
.PP
p, t, c, m, i
