.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
At boot,
\fBsystemd-sysctl.service\fR(8)
reads configuration files from the above directories to configure
\fBsysctl\fR(8)
kernel parameters\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION FORMAT"
.PP
The configuration files contain a list of variable assignments, separated by newlines\&. Empty lines and lines whose first non\-whitespace character is
"#"
or
";"
are ignored\&.
.PP
Note that either
"/"
or
"\&."
may be used as separators within sysctl variable names\&. If the first separator is a slash, remaining slashes and dots are left intact\&. If the first separator is a dot, dots and slashes are interchanged\&.
"kernel\&.domainname=foo"
and
"kernel/domainname=foo"
are equivalent and will cause
"foo"
to be written to
/proc/sys/kernel/domainname\&. Either
"net\&.ipv4\&.conf\&.enp3s0/200\&.forwarding"
or
"net/ipv4/conf/enp3s0\&.200/forwarding"
may be used to refer to
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/enp3s0\&.200/forwarding\&. A glob
\fBglob\fR(7)
pattern may be used to write the same value to all matching keys\&. Keys for which an explicit pattern exists will be excluded from any glob matching\&. In addition, a key may be explicitly excluded from being set by any matching glob patterns by specifying the key name prefixed with a
"\-"
character and not followed by
"=", see SYNOPSIS\&.
.PP
Any access permission errors and attempts to write variables not present on the local system are logged at debug level and do not cause the service to fail\&. Other types of errors when setting variables are logged with higher priority and cause the service to return failure at the end (after processing other variables)\&. As an exception, if a variable assignment is prefixed with a single
"\-"
character, failure to set the variable for any reason will be logged at debug level and will not cause the service to fail\&.
.PP
The settings configured with
sysctl\&.d
files will be applied early on boot\&. The network interface\-specific options will also be applied individually for each network interface as it shows up in the system\&. (More specifically,
net\&.ipv4\&.conf\&.*,
net\&.ipv6\&.conf\&.*,
net\&.ipv4\&.neigh\&.*
and
net\&.ipv6\&.neigh\&.*)\&.
.PP
Many sysctl parameters only become available when certain kernel modules are loaded\&. Modules are usually loaded on demand, e\&.g\&. when certain hardware is plugged in or network brought up\&. This means that
\fBsystemd-sysctl.service\fR(8)
which runs during early boot will not configure such parameters if they become available after it has run\&. To set such parameters, it is recommended to add an
\fBudev\fR(7)
rule to set those parameters when they become available\&. Alternatively, a slightly simpler and less efficient option is to add the module to
\fBmodules-load.d\fR(5), causing it to be loaded statically before sysctl settings are applied (see example below)\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE"
.PP
Configuration files are read from directories in
/etc/,
/run/,
/usr/local/lib/, and
/usr/lib/, in order of precedence, as listed in the SYNOPSIS section above\&. Files must have the
"\&.conf"
extension\&. Files in
/etc/
override files with the same name in
/run/,
/usr/local/lib/, and
/usr/lib/\&. Files in
/run/
override files with the same name under
/usr/\&.
.PP
All configuration files are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of which of the directories they reside in\&. If multiple files specify the same option, the entry in the file with the lexicographically latest name will take precedence\&. Thus, the configuration in a certain file may either be replaced completely (by placing a file with the same name in a directory with higher priority), or individual settings might be changed (by specifying additional settings in a file with a different name that is ordered later)\&.
.PP
Packages should install their configuration files in
/usr/lib/
(distribution packages) or
/usr/local/lib/
(local installs)\&. Files in
/etc/
are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration files installed by vendor packages\&. It is recommended to prefix all filenames with a two\-digit number and a dash, to simplify the ordering of the files\&.
.PP
If the administrator wants to disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to
/dev/null
in the configuration directory in
/etc/, with the same filename as the vendor configuration file\&. If the vendor configuration file is included in the initrd image, the image has to be regenerated\&.

This method applies settings when the module is loaded\&. Please note that, unless the

module is loaded, bridged packets will not be filtered by Netfilter (starting with kernel 3\&.18), so simply not loading the module is sufficient to avoid filtering\&.

This method forces the module to be always loaded\&. Please note that, unless the

The

key will be set to "2" for all interfaces, except "hub0"\&. We set
net\&.ipv4\&.conf\&.default\&.rp_filter
first, so any interfaces which are added
\fIlater\fR
will get this value (this also covers any interfaces detected while we\*(Aqre running)\&. The glob matches any interfaces which were detected
\fIearlier\fR\&. The glob will also match
net\&.ipv4\&.conf\&.all\&.rp_filter, which we don\*(Aqt want to set at all, so it is explicitly excluded\&. And "hub0" is excluded from the glob because it has an explicit setting\&.
