.SH "NAME"
systemd.dnssd \- DNS\-SD configuration
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fInetwork_service\fR\&.dnssd
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
DNS\-SD setup is performed by
\fBsystemd-resolved\fR(8)\&.
.PP
The main network service file must have the extension
\&.dnssd; other extensions are ignored\&.
.PP
The
\&.dnssd
files are read from the files located in the system network directories
/usr/lib/systemd/dnssd
and
/usr/local/lib/systemd/dnssd, the volatile runtime network directory
/run/systemd/dnssd
and the local administration network directory
/etc/systemd/dnssd\&. All configuration files are collectively sorted and processed in lexical order, regardless of the directories in which they live\&. However, files with identical filenames replace each other\&. Files in
/etc/
have the highest priority, files in
/run/
take precedence over files with the same name in
/usr/lib/\&. This can be used to override a system\-supplied configuration file with a local file if needed\&.
.PP
Along with the network service file
foo\&.dnssd, a "drop\-in" directory
foo\&.dnssd\&.d/
may exist\&. All files with the suffix
"\&.conf"
from this directory will be parsed after the file itself is parsed\&. This is useful to alter or add configuration settings, without having to modify the main configuration file\&. Each drop\-in file must have appropriate section headers\&.
.PP
In addition to
/etc/systemd/dnssd, drop\-in
"\&.d"
directories can be placed in
/usr/lib/systemd/dnssd
or
/run/systemd/dnssd
directories\&. Drop\-in files in
/etc/
take precedence over those in
/run/
which in turn take precedence over those in
/usr/lib/
or
/usr/local/lib\&. Drop\-in files under any of these directories take precedence over the main network service file wherever located\&.
.SH "[SERVICE] SECTION OPTIONS"
.PP
The network service file contains a [Service] section, which specifies a discoverable network service announced in a local network with Multicast DNS broadcasts\&.
.PP
\fIName=\fR
.RS 4
An instance name of the network service as defined in the section 4\&.1\&.1 of
\m[blue]\fBRFC 6763\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2, e\&.g\&.
"webserver"\&.
.sp
The option supports simple specifier expansion\&. The following expansions are understood:
