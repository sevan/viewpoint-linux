.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
A unit file is a plain text ini\-style file that encodes information about a service, a socket, a device, a mount point, an automount point, a swap file or partition, a start\-up target, a watched file system path, a timer controlled and supervised by
\fBsystemd\fR(1), a resource management slice or a group of externally created processes\&. See
\fBsystemd.syntax\fR(7)
for a general description of the syntax\&.
.PP
This man page lists the common configuration options of all the unit types\&. These options need to be configured in the [Unit] or [Install] sections of the unit files\&.
.PP
In addition to the generic [Unit] and [Install] sections described here, each unit may have a type\-specific section, e\&.g\&. [Service] for a service unit\&. See the respective man pages for more information:
\fBsystemd.service\fR(5),
\fBsystemd.socket\fR(5),
\fBsystemd.device\fR(5),
\fBsystemd.mount\fR(5),
\fBsystemd.automount\fR(5),
\fBsystemd.swap\fR(5),
\fBsystemd.target\fR(5),
\fBsystemd.path\fR(5),
\fBsystemd.timer\fR(5),
\fBsystemd.slice\fR(5),
\fBsystemd.scope\fR(5)\&.
.PP
Unit files are loaded from a set of paths determined during compilation, described in the next section\&.
.PP
Valid unit names consist of a "name prefix" and a dot and a suffix specifying the unit type\&. The "unit prefix" must consist of one or more valid characters (ASCII letters, digits,
":",
"\-",
"_",
"\&.", and
"\e")\&. The total length of the unit name including the suffix must not exceed 256 characters\&. The type suffix must be one of
"\&.service",
"\&.socket",
"\&.device",
"\&.mount",
"\&.automount",
"\&.swap",
"\&.target",
"\&.path",
"\&.timer",
"\&.slice", or
"\&.scope"\&.
.PP
Units names can be parameterized by a single argument called the "instance name"\&. The unit is then constructed based on a "template file" which serves as the definition of multiple services or other units\&. A template unit must have a single
"@"
at the end of the name (right before the type suffix)\&. The name of the full unit is formed by inserting the instance name between
"@"
and the unit type suffix\&. In the unit file itself, the instance parameter may be referred to using
"%i"
and other specifiers, see below\&.
.PP
Unit files may contain additional options on top of those listed here\&. If systemd encounters an unknown option, it will write a warning log message but continue loading the unit\&. If an option or section name is prefixed with
\fBX\-\fR, it is ignored completely by systemd\&. Options within an ignored section do not need the prefix\&. Applications may use this to include additional information in the unit files\&.
.PP
Units can be aliased (have an alternative name), by creating a symlink from the new name to the existing name in one of the unit search paths\&. For example,
systemd\-networkd\&.service
has the alias
dbus\-org\&.freedesktop\&.network1\&.service, created during installation as a symlink, so when
\fBsystemd\fR
is asked through D\-Bus to load
dbus\-org\&.freedesktop\&.network1\&.service, it\*(Aqll load
systemd\-networkd\&.service\&. As another example,
default\&.target
\(em the default system target started at boot \(em is commonly symlinked (aliased) to either
multi\-user\&.target
or
graphical\&.target
to select what is started by default\&. Alias names may be used in commands like
\fBdisable\fR,
\fBstart\fR,
\fBstop\fR,
\fBstatus\fR, and similar, and in all unit dependency directives, including
\fIWants=\fR,
\fIRequires=\fR,
\fIBefore=\fR,
\fIAfter=\fR\&. Aliases cannot be used with the
\fBpreset\fR
command\&.
.PP
Aliases obey the following restrictions: a unit of a certain type ("\&.service",
"\&.socket", \&...) can only be aliased by a name with the same type suffix\&. A plain unit (not a template or an instance), may only be aliased by a plain name\&. A template instance may only be aliased by another template instance, and the instance part must be identical\&. A template may be aliased by another template (in which case the alias applies to all instances of the template)\&. As a special case, a template instance (e\&.g\&.
"alias@inst\&.service") may be a symlink to different template (e\&.g\&.
"template@inst\&.service")\&. In that case, just this specific instance is aliased, while other instances of the template (e\&.g\&.
"alias@foo\&.service",
"alias@bar\&.service") are not aliased\&. Those rule preserve the requirement that the instance (if any) is always uniquely defined for a given unit and all its aliases\&.
.PP
Unit files may specify aliases through the
\fIAlias=\fR
directive in the [Install] section\&. When the unit is enabled, symlinks will be created for those names, and removed when the unit is disabled\&. For example,
reboot\&.target
specifies
\fIAlias=ctrl\-alt\-del\&.target\fR, so when enabled, the symlink
/etc/systemd/system/ctrl\-alt\-del\&.service
pointing to the
reboot\&.target
file will be created, and when
Ctrl+Alt+Del
is invoked,
\fBsystemd\fR
will look for the
ctrl\-alt\-del\&.service
and execute
reboot\&.service\&.
\fBsystemd\fR
does not look at the [Install] section at all during normal operation, so any directives in that section only have an effect through the symlinks created during enablement\&.
.PP
Along with a unit file
foo\&.service, the directory
foo\&.service\&.wants/
may exist\&. All unit files symlinked from such a directory are implicitly added as dependencies of type
\fIWants=\fR
to the unit\&. Similar functionality exists for
\fIRequires=\fR
type dependencies as well, the directory suffix is
\&.requires/
in this case\&. This functionality is useful to hook units into the start\-up of other units, without having to modify their unit files\&. For details about the semantics of
\fIWants=\fR, see below\&. The preferred way to create symlinks in the
\&.wants/
or
\&.requires/
directory of a unit file is by embedding the dependency in [Install] section of the target unit, and creating the symlink in the file system with the
\fBenable\fR
or
\fBpreset\fR
commands of
\fBsystemctl\fR(1)\&.
.PP
Along with a unit file
foo\&.service, a "drop\-in" directory
foo\&.service\&.d/
may exist\&. All files with the suffix
"\&.conf"
from this directory will be parsed after the unit file itself is parsed\&. This is useful to alter or add configuration settings for a unit, without having to modify unit files\&. Drop\-in files must contain appropriate section headers\&. For instantiated units, this logic will first look for the instance
"\&.d/"
subdirectory (e\&.g\&.
"foo@bar\&.service\&.d/") and read its
"\&.conf"
files, followed by the template
"\&.d/"
subdirectory (e\&.g\&.
"foo@\&.service\&.d/") and the
"\&.conf"
files there\&. Moreover for unit names containing dashes ("\-"), the set of directories generated by repeatedly truncating the unit name after all dashes is searched too\&. Specifically, for a unit name
foo\-bar\-baz\&.service
not only the regular drop\-in directory
foo\-bar\-baz\&.service\&.d/
is searched but also both
foo\-bar\-\&.service\&.d/
and
foo\-\&.service\&.d/\&. This is useful for defining common drop\-ins for a set of related units, whose names begin with a common prefix\&. This scheme is particularly useful for mount, automount and slice units, whose systematic naming structure is built around dashes as component separators\&. Note that equally named drop\-in files further down the prefix hierarchy override those further up, i\&.e\&.
foo\-bar\-\&.service\&.d/10\-override\&.conf
overrides
foo\-\&.service\&.d/10\-override\&.conf\&.
.PP
In cases of unit aliases (described above), dropins for the aliased name and all aliases are loaded\&. In the example of
default\&.target
aliasing
graphical\&.target,
default\&.target\&.d/,
default\&.target\&.wants/,
default\&.target\&.requires/,
graphical\&.target\&.d/,
graphical\&.target\&.wants/,
graphical\&.target\&.requires/
would all be read\&. For templates, dropins for the template, any template aliases, the template instance, and all alias instances are read\&. When just a specific template instance is aliased, then the dropins for the target template, the target template instance, and the alias template instance are read\&.
.PP
In addition to
/etc/systemd/system, the drop\-in
"\&.d/"
directories for system services can be placed in
/usr/lib/systemd/system
or
/run/systemd/system
directories\&. Drop\-in files in
/etc/
take precedence over those in
/run/
which in turn take precedence over those in
/usr/lib/\&. Drop\-in files under any of these directories take precedence over unit files wherever located\&. Multiple drop\-in files with different names are applied in lexicographic order, regardless of which of the directories they reside in\&.
.PP
Units also support a top\-level drop\-in with
\fItype\fR\&.d/, where
\fItype\fR
may be e\&.g\&.
"service"
or
"socket", that allows altering or adding to the settings of all corresponding unit files on the system\&. The formatting and precedence of applying drop\-in configurations follow what is defined above\&. Configurations in
\fItype\fR\&.d/
have the lowest precedence compared to settings in the name specific override directories\&. So the contents of
foo\-\&.service\&.d/10\-override\&.conf
would override
service\&.d/10\-override\&.conf\&.
.PP
Note that while systemd offers a flexible dependency system between units it is recommended to use this functionality only sparingly and instead rely on techniques such as bus\-based or socket\-based activation which make dependencies implicit, resulting in a both simpler and more flexible system\&.
.PP
As mentioned above, a unit may be instantiated from a template file\&. This allows creation of multiple units from a single configuration file\&. If systemd looks for a unit configuration file, it will first search for the literal unit name in the file system\&. If that yields no success and the unit name contains an
"@"
character, systemd will look for a unit template that shares the same name but with the instance string (i\&.e\&. the part between the
"@"
character and the suffix) removed\&. Example: if a service
getty@tty3\&.service
is requested and no file by that name is found, systemd will look for
getty@\&.service
and instantiate a service from that configuration file if it is found\&.
.PP
To refer to the instance string from within the configuration file you may use the special
"%i"
specifier in many of the configuration options\&. See below for details\&.
.PP
If a unit file is empty (i\&.e\&. has the file size 0) or is symlinked to
/dev/null, its configuration will not be loaded and it appears with a load state of
"masked", and cannot be activated\&. Use this as an effective way to fully disable a unit, making it impossible to start it even manually\&.
.PP
The unit file format is covered by the
\m[blue]\fBInterface Portability and Stability Promise\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2\&.
.SH "STRING ESCAPING FOR INCLUSION IN UNIT NAMES"
.PP
Sometimes it is useful to convert arbitrary strings into unit names\&. To facilitate this, a method of string escaping is used, in order to map strings containing arbitrary byte values (except
\fBNUL\fR) into valid unit names and their restricted character set\&. A common special case are unit names that reflect paths to objects in the file system hierarchy\&. Example: a device unit
dev\-sda\&.device
refers to a device with the device node
/dev/sda
in the file system\&.
.PP
The escaping algorithm operates as follows: given a string, any
"/"
character is replaced by
"\-", and all other characters which are not ASCII alphanumerics or
"_"
are replaced by C\-style
"\ex2d"
escapes\&. In addition,
"\&."
is replaced with such a C\-style escape when it would appear as the first character in the escaped string\&.
.PP
When the input qualifies as absolute file system path, this algorithm is extended slightly: the path to the root directory
"/"
is encoded as single dash
"\-"\&. In addition, any leading, trailing or duplicate
"/"
characters are removed from the string before transformation\&. Example:
/foo//bar/baz/
becomes
"foo\-bar\-baz"\&.
.PP
This escaping is fully reversible, as long as it is known whether the escaped string was a path (the unescaping results are different for paths and non\-path strings)\&. The
\fBsystemd-escape\fR(1)
command may be used to apply and reverse escaping on arbitrary strings\&. Use
\fBsystemd\-escape \-\-path\fR
to escape path strings, and
\fBsystemd\-escape\fR
without
\fB\-\-path\fR
otherwise\&.
.SH "AUTOMATIC DEPENDENCIES"
.SS "Implicit Dependencies"
.PP
A number of unit dependencies are implicitly established, depending on unit type and unit configuration\&. These implicit dependencies can make unit configuration file cleaner\&. For the implicit dependencies in each unit type, please refer to section "Implicit Dependencies" in respective man pages\&.
.PP
For example, service units with
\fIType=dbus\fR
automatically acquire dependencies of type
\fIRequires=\fR
and
\fIAfter=\fR
on
dbus\&.socket\&. See
\fBsystemd.service\fR(5)
for details\&.
.SS "Default Dependencies"
.PP
Default dependencies are similar to implicit dependencies, but can be turned on and off by setting
\fIDefaultDependencies=\fR
to
\fIyes\fR
(the default) and
\fIno\fR, while implicit dependencies are always in effect\&. See section "Default Dependencies" in respective man pages for the effect of enabling
\fIDefaultDependencies=\fR
in each unit types\&.
.PP
For example, target units will complement all configured dependencies of type
\fIWants=\fR
or
\fIRequires=\fR
with dependencies of type
\fIAfter=\fR
unless
\fIDefaultDependencies=no\fR
is set in the specified units\&. See
\fBsystemd.target\fR(5)
for details\&. Note that this behavior can be turned off by setting
\fIDefaultDependencies=no\fR\&.
.SH "UNIT FILE LOAD PATH"
.PP
Unit files are loaded from a set of paths determined during compilation, described in the two tables below\&. Unit files found in directories listed earlier override files with the same name in directories lower in the list\&.
.PP
When the variable
\fI$SYSTEMD_UNIT_PATH\fR
is set, the contents of this variable overrides the unit load path\&. If
\fI$SYSTEMD_UNIT_PATH\fR
ends with an empty component (":"), the usual unit load path will be appended to the contents of the variable\&.

Moreover, additional units might be loaded into systemd from directories not on the unit load path by creating a symlink pointing to a unit file in the directories\&. You can use

.SH "UNIT GARBAGE COLLECTION"
.PP
The system and service manager loads a unit\*(Aqs configuration automatically when a unit is referenced for the first time\&.

.RE
.PP
The garbage collection logic may be altered with the
\fICollectMode=\fR
option, which allows configuration whether automatic unloading of units that are in
\fBfailed\fR
state is permissible, see below\&.
.PP
Note that when a unit\*(Aqs configuration and state is unloaded, all execution results, such as exit codes, exit signals, resource consumption and other statistics are lost, except for what is stored in the log subsystem\&.
.PP
Use
\fBsystemctl daemon\-reload\fR
or an equivalent command to reload unit configuration while the unit is already loaded\&. In this case all configuration settings are flushed out and replaced with the new configuration (which however might not be in effect immediately), however all runtime state is saved/restored\&.
.SH "[UNIT] SECTION OPTIONS"
.PP
The unit file may include a [Unit] section, which carries generic information about the unit that is not dependent on the type of unit:
.PP
\fIDescription=\fR
.RS 4
A human readable name for the unit\&. This is used by
\fBsystemd\fR
(and other UIs) as the label for the unit, so this string should identify the unit rather than describe it, despite the name\&.
"Apache2 Web Server"
is a good example\&. Bad examples are
"high\-performance light\-weight HTTP server"
(too generic) or
"Apache2"
(too specific and meaningless for people who do not know Apache)\&.
\fBsystemd\fR
will use this string as a noun in status messages ("Starting \fIdescription\fR\&.\&.\&.",
"Started \fIdescription\fR\&.",
"Reached target \fIdescription\fR\&.",
"Failed to start \fIdescription\fR\&."), so it should be capitalized, and should not be a full sentence or a phrase with a continuous verb\&. Bad examples include
"exiting the container"
or
"updating the database once per day\&."\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIDocumentation=\fR
.RS 4
A space\-separated list of URIs referencing documentation for this unit or its configuration\&. Accepted are only URIs of the types
"http://",
"https://",
"file:",
"info:",
"man:"\&. For more information about the syntax of these URIs, see
\fBuri\fR(7)\&. The URIs should be listed in order of relevance, starting with the most relevant\&.

Units listed in this option will be started if the configuring unit is\&.

This is the recommended way to hook the start\-up of one unit to the start\-up of another unit\&.

If this unit gets activated, the units listed will be activated as well\&. If one of the other units fails to activate, and an ordering dependency

Often, it is a better choice to use

Note that this dependency type does not imply that the other unit always has to be in active state when this unit is running\&. Specifically: failing condition checks (such as
\fIConditionPathExists=\fR,

\fIBindsTo=\fR

Configures requirement dependencies, very similar in style to
\fIRequires=\fR\&. However, this dependency type is stronger: in addition to the effect of
\fIRequires=\fR
it declares that if the unit bound to is stopped, this unit will be stopped too\&. This means a unit bound to another unit that suddenly enters inactive state will be stopped too\&. Units can suddenly, unexpectedly enter inactive state for different reasons: the main process of a service unit might terminate on its own choice, the backing device of a device unit might be unplugged or the mount point of a mount unit might be unmounted without involvement of the system and service manager\&.
.sp
When used in conjunction with
\fIAfter=\fR
on the same unit the behaviour of
\fIBindsTo=\fR
is even stronger\&. In this case, the unit bound to strictly has to be in active state for this unit to also be in active state\&. This not only means a unit bound to another unit that suddenly enters inactive state, but also one that is bound to another unit that gets skipped due to a failed condition check (such as
\fIConditionPathExists=\fR,
\fIConditionPathIsSymbolicLink=\fR, \&... \(em see below) will be stopped, should it be running\&. Hence, in many cases it is best to combine

.sp
Note that this setting does not imply an ordering dependency, similarly to the
\fIWants=\fR

\fIRequires=\fR
dependencies described above\&. This means that to ensure that the conflicting unit is stopped before the other unit is started, an
\fIAfter=\fR

These two settings expect a space\-separated list of unit names\&. They may be specified more than once, in which case dependencies for all listed names are created\&.
.sp
Those two settings configure ordering dependencies between units\&. If unit
foo\&.service
contains the setting
\fBBefore=bar\&.service\fR
and both units are being started,
bar\&.service\*(Aqs start\-up is delayed until
foo\&.service
has finished starting up\&.
\fIAfter=\fR
is the inverse of
\fIBefore=\fR, i\&.e\&. while
\fIBefore=\fR
ensures that the configured unit is started before the listed unit begins starting up,
\fIAfter=\fR
ensures the opposite, that the listed unit is fully started up before the configured unit is started\&.
.sp
When two units with an ordering dependency between them are shut down, the inverse of the start\-up order is applied\&. I\&.e\&. if a unit is configured with
\fIAfter=\fR
on another unit, the former is stopped before the latter if both are shut down\&. Given two units with any ordering dependency between them, if one unit is shut down and the other is started up, the shutdown is ordered before the start\-up\&. It doesn\*(Aqt matter if the ordering dependency is
\fIAfter=\fR
or
\fIBefore=\fR, in this case\&. It also doesn\*(Aqt matter which of the two is shut down, as long as one is shut down and the other is started up; the shutdown is ordered before the start\-up in all cases\&. If two units have no ordering dependencies between them, they are shut down or started up simultaneously, and no ordering takes place\&. It depends on the unit type when precisely a unit has finished starting up\&. Most importantly, for service units start\-up is considered completed for the purpose of
\fIBefore=\fR/\fIAfter=\fR
when all its configured start\-up commands have been invoked and they either failed or reported start\-up success\&. Note that this does includes
\fIExecStartPost=\fR
(or
\fIExecStopPost=\fR

.sp
Note that those settings are independent of and orthogonal to the requirement dependencies as configured by
\fIRequires=\fR,
\fIWants=\fR,
\fIRequisite=\fR, or
\fIBindsTo=\fR\&. It is a common pattern to include a unit name in both the

\fIConditionKernelCommandLine=\fR
may be used to check whether a specific kernel command line option is set (or if prefixed with the exclamation mark \(em unset)\&. The argument must either be a single word, or an assignment (i\&.e\&. two words, separated by
"=")\&. In the former case the kernel command line is searched for the word appearing as is, or as left hand side of an assignment\&. In the latter case, the exact assignment is looked for with right and left hand side matching\&. This operates on the kernel command line communicated to userspace via

\fIConditionKernelVersion=\fR
may be used to check whether the kernel version (as reported by

a relative version comparison is done, otherwise the specified string is matched with shell\-style globs\&.
.sp
Note that using the kernel version string is an unreliable way to determine which features are supported by a kernel, because of the widespread practice of backporting drivers, features, and fixes from newer upstream kernels into older versions provided by distributions\&. Hence, this check is inherently unportable and should not be used for units which may be used on different distributions\&.

\fIConditionEnvironment=\fR
.RS 4
\fIConditionEnvironment=\fR

The argument may be a single word, to check if the variable with this name is defined in the environment block, or an assignment ("\fIname\fR=\fIvalue\fR"), to check if the variable with this exact value is defined\&. Note that the environment block of the service manager itself is checked, i\&.e\&. not any variables defined with

Takes one of

\fBExample\ \&1.\ \&Allowing units to be enabled\fR
.PP
The following snippet (highlighted) allows a unit (e\&.g\&.
foo\&.service) to be enabled via
\fBsystemctl enable\fR:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[Unit]
Description=Foo

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/foo\-daemon

\fI[Install]\fR
\fIWantedBy=multi\-user\&.target\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
After running
\fBsystemctl enable\fR, a symlink
/etc/systemd/system/multi\-user\&.target\&.wants/foo\&.service
linking to the actual unit will be created\&. It tells systemd to pull in the unit when starting
multi\-user\&.target\&. The inverse
\fBsystemctl disable\fR
will remove that symlink again\&.
.PP
\fBExample\ \&2.\ \&Overriding vendor settings\fR
.PP
There are two methods of overriding vendor settings in unit files: copying the unit file from
/usr/lib/systemd/system
to
/etc/systemd/system
and modifying the chosen settings\&. Alternatively, one can create a directory named
\fIunit\fR\&.d/
within
/etc/systemd/system
and place a drop\-in file
\fIname\fR\&.conf
there that only changes the specific settings one is interested in\&. Note that multiple such drop\-in files are read if present, processed in lexicographic order of their filename\&.
.PP
The advantage of the first method is that one easily overrides the complete unit, the vendor unit is not parsed at all anymore\&. It has the disadvantage that improvements to the unit file by the vendor are not automatically incorporated on updates\&.
.PP
The advantage of the second method is that one only overrides the settings one specifically wants, where updates to the unit by the vendor automatically apply\&. This has the disadvantage that some future updates by the vendor might be incompatible with the local changes\&.
.PP
This also applies for user instances of systemd, but with different locations for the unit files\&. See the section on unit load paths for further details\&.
.PP
Suppose there is a vendor\-supplied unit
/usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd\&.service
with the following contents:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[Unit]
Description=Some HTTP server
After=remote\-fs\&.target sqldb\&.service
Requires=sqldb\&.service
AssertPathExists=/srv/webserver

[Service]
Type=notify
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/some\-fancy\-httpd\-server
Nice=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi\-user\&.target
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Now one wants to change some settings as an administrator: firstly, in the local setup,
/srv/webserver
might not exist, because the HTTP server is configured to use
/srv/www
instead\&. Secondly, the local configuration makes the HTTP server also depend on a memory cache service,
memcached\&.service, that should be pulled in (\fIRequires=\fR) and also be ordered appropriately (\fIAfter=\fR)\&. Thirdly, in order to harden the service a bit more, the administrator would like to set the
\fIPrivateTmp=\fR
setting (see
\fBsystemd.exec\fR(5)
for details)\&. And lastly, the administrator would like to reset the niceness of the service to its default value of 0\&.
.PP
The first possibility is to copy the unit file to
/etc/systemd/system/httpd\&.service
and change the chosen settings:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[Unit]
Description=Some HTTP server
After=remote\-fs\&.target sqldb\&.service \fImemcached\&.service\fR
Requires=sqldb\&.service \fImemcached\&.service\fR
AssertPathExists=\fI/srv/www\fR

[Service]
Type=notify
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/some\-fancy\-httpd\-server
\fINice=0\fR
\fIPrivateTmp=yes\fR

[Install]
WantedBy=multi\-user\&.target
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Alternatively, the administrator could create a drop\-in file
/etc/systemd/system/httpd\&.service\&.d/local\&.conf
with the following contents:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[Unit]
After=memcached\&.service
Requires=memcached\&.service
# Reset all assertions and then re\-add the condition we want
AssertPathExists=
AssertPathExists=/srv/www

[Service]
Nice=0
PrivateTmp=yes
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Note that for drop\-in files, if one wants to remove entries from a setting that is parsed as a list (and is not a dependency), such as
\fIAssertPathExists=\fR
(or e\&.g\&.
\fIExecStart=\fR
in service units), one needs to first clear the list before re\-adding all entries except the one that is to be removed\&. Dependencies (\fIAfter=\fR, etc\&.) cannot be reset to an empty list, so dependencies can only be added in drop\-ins\&. If you want to remove dependencies, you have to override the entire unit\&.
