.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
systemd\-suspend\&.service
is a system service that is pulled in by
suspend\&.target
and is responsible for the actual system suspend\&. Similarly,
systemd\-hibernate\&.service
is pulled in by
hibernate\&.target
to execute the actual hibernation\&. Finally,
systemd\-hybrid\-sleep\&.service
is pulled in by
hybrid\-sleep\&.target
to execute hybrid hibernation with system suspend and pulled in by
suspend\-then\-hibernate\&.target
to execute system suspend with a timeout that will activate hibernate later\&.
.PP
Immediately before entering system suspend and/or hibernation
systemd\-suspend\&.service
(and the other mentioned units, respectively) will run all executables in
/usr/lib/systemd/system\-sleep/
and pass two arguments to them\&. The first argument will be
"pre", the second either
"suspend",
"hibernate",
"hybrid\-sleep", or
"suspend\-then\-hibernate"
depending on the chosen action\&. An environment variable called
"SYSTEMD_SLEEP_ACTION"
will be set and contain the sleep action that is processing\&. This is primarily helpful for
"suspend\-then\-hibernate"
where the value of the variable will be
"suspend",
"hibernate", or
"suspend\-after\-failed\-hibernate"
in cases where hibernation has failed\&. Immediately after leaving system suspend and/or hibernation the same executables are run, but the first argument is now
"post"\&. All executables in this directory are executed in parallel, and execution of the action is not continued until all executables have finished\&.
.PP
Note that scripts or binaries dropped in
/usr/lib/systemd/system\-sleep/
are intended for local use only and should be considered hacks\&. If applications want to react to system suspend/hibernation and resume, they should rather use the
\m[blue]\fBInhibitor interface\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2\&.
.PP
Note that
systemd\-suspend\&.service,
systemd\-hibernate\&.service,
systemd\-hybrid\-sleep\&.service, and
systemd\-suspend\-then\-hibernate\&.service
should never be executed directly\&. Instead, trigger system sleep with a command such as
\fBsystemctl suspend\fR
or
\fBsystemctl hibernate\fR\&.
.PP
Internally, this service will echo a string like
"mem"
into
/sys/power/state, to trigger the actual system suspend\&. What exactly is written where can be configured in the [Sleep] section of
/etc/systemd/sleep\&.conf
or a
sleep\&.conf\&.d
file\&. See
\fBsystemd-sleep.conf\fR(5)\&.
