.SH "NAME"
systemd-udev-settle.service \- Wait for all pending udev events to be handled
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
systemd\-udev\-settle\&.service
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This service calls
\fBudevadm settle\fR
to wait until all events that have been queued by
\fBudev\fR(7)
have been processed\&. It is a crude way to wait until "all" hardware has been discovered\&. Services may pull in this service and order themselves after it to wait for the udev queue to be empty\&.
.PP
\fIUsing this service is not recommended\&.\fR
There can be no guarantee that hardware is fully discovered at any specific time, because the kernel does hardware detection asynchronously, and certain buses and devices take a very long time to become ready, and also additional hardware may be plugged in at any time\&. Instead, services should subscribe to udev events and react to any new hardware as it is discovered\&. Services that, based on configuration, expect certain devices to appear, may warn or report failure after a timeout\&. This timeout should be tailored to the hardware type\&. Waiting for
systemd\-udev\-settle\&.service
usually slows boot significantly, because it means waiting for all unrelated events too\&.
