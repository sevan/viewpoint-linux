.SH "NAME"
coredump.conf, coredump.conf.d \- Core dump storage configuration files
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
/etc/systemd/coredump\&.conf
.PP
/etc/systemd/coredump\&.conf\&.d/*\&.conf
.PP
/run/systemd/coredump\&.conf\&.d/*\&.conf
.PP
/usr/lib/systemd/coredump\&.conf\&.d/*\&.conf
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
These files configure the behavior of
\fBsystemd-coredump\fR(8), a handler for core dumps invoked by the kernel\&. Whether
\fBsystemd\-coredump\fR
is used is determined by the kernel\*(Aqs
\fIkernel\&.core_pattern\fR\ \&\fBsysctl\fR(8)
setting\&. See
\fBsystemd-coredump\fR(8)
and
\fBcore\fR(5)
pages for the details\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE"
.PP
The default configuration is set during compilation, so configuration is only needed when it is necessary to deviate from those defaults\&. Initially, the main configuration file in
/etc/systemd/
contains commented out entries showing the defaults as a guide to the administrator\&. Local overrides can be created by editing this file or by creating drop\-ins, as described below\&. Using drop\-ins for local configuration is recommended over modifications to the main configuration file\&.
.PP
In addition to the "main" configuration file, drop\-in configuration snippets are read from
/usr/lib/systemd/*\&.conf\&.d/,
/usr/local/lib/systemd/*\&.conf\&.d/, and
/etc/systemd/*\&.conf\&.d/\&. Those drop\-ins have higher precedence and override the main configuration file\&. Files in the
*\&.conf\&.d/
configuration subdirectories are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in which of the subdirectories they reside\&. When multiple files specify the same option, for options which accept just a single value, the entry in the file sorted last takes precedence, and for options which accept a list of values, entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files\&.
.PP
When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install drop\-ins under
/usr/\&. Files in
/etc/
are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration files installed by vendor packages\&. Drop\-ins have to be used to override package drop\-ins, since the main configuration file has lower precedence\&. It is recommended to prefix all filenames in those subdirectories with a two\-digit number and a dash, to simplify the ordering of the files\&.
.PP
To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to
/dev/null
in the configuration directory in
/etc/, with the same filename as the vendor configuration file\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
All options are configured in the [Coredump] section:
.PP
\fIStorage=\fR
.RS 4
Controls where to store cores\&. One of
"none",
"external", and
"journal"\&. When
"none", the core dumps may be logged (including the backtrace if possible), but not stored permanently\&. When
"external"
(the default), cores will be stored in
/var/lib/systemd/coredump/\&. When
"journal", cores will be stored in the journal and rotated following normal journal rotation patterns\&.
.sp
When cores are stored in the journal, they might be compressed following journal compression settings, see
\fBjournald.conf\fR(5)\&. When cores are stored externally, they will be compressed by default, see below\&.
.RE
.PP
\fICompress=\fR
.RS 4
Controls compression for external storage\&. Takes a boolean argument, which defaults to
"yes"\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIProcessSizeMax=\fR
.RS 4
The maximum size in bytes of a core which will be processed\&. Core dumps exceeding this size may be stored, but the backtrace will not be generated\&.
.sp
Setting
\fIStorage=none\fR
and
\fIProcessSizeMax=0\fR
disables all coredump handling except for a log entry\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIExternalSizeMax=\fR, \fIJournalSizeMax=\fR
.RS 4
The maximum (uncompressed) size in bytes of a core to be saved\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIMaxUse=\fR, \fIKeepFree=\fR
.RS 4
Enforce limits on the disk space taken up by externally stored core dumps\&.
\fBMaxUse=\fR
makes sure that old core dumps are removed as soon as the total disk space taken up by core dumps grows beyond this limit (defaults to 10% of the total disk size)\&.
\fBKeepFree=\fR
controls how much disk space to keep free at least (defaults to 15% of the total disk size)\&. Note that the disk space used by core dumps might temporarily exceed these limits while core dumps are processed\&. Note that old core dumps are also removed based on time via
\fBsystemd-tmpfiles\fR(8)\&. Set either value to 0 to turn off size\-based clean\-up\&.
.RE
.PP
The defaults for all values are listed as comments in the template
/etc/systemd/coredump\&.conf
file that is installed by default\&.
