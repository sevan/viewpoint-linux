  <term><option>MD5_CRYPT_ENAB</option> (boolean)</term>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Indicate if passwords must be encrypted using the MD5-based
      algorithm. If set to <replaceable>yes</replaceable>, new passwords
      will be encrypted using the MD5-based algorithm compatible with the
      one used by recent releases of FreeBSD. It supports passwords of
      unlimited length and longer salt strings. Set to
      <replaceable>no</replaceable> if you need to copy encrypted
      passwords to other systems which don't understand the new algorithm.
      Default is <replaceable>no</replaceable>.
    </para>
    <para>
      This variable is superseded by the <option>ENCRYPT_METHOD</option>
      variable or by any command line option used to configure the
      encryption algorithm.
    </para>
    <para>
      This variable is deprecated. You should use
      <option>ENCRYPT_METHOD</option>.
    </para>
    <para condition="pam">
      Note: This only affect the generation of group passwords.
      The generation of user passwords is done by PAM and subject to the
      PAM configuration. It is recommended to set this variable
      consistently with the PAM configuration.
