  <term><option>MAX_MEMBERS_PER_GROUP</option> (number)</term>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Maximum members per group entry. When the maximum is reached, a new
      group entry (line) is started in <filename>/etc/group</filename>
      (with the same name, same password, and same GID).
    </para>
    <para>
      The default value is 0, meaning that there are no limits in the
      number of members in a group.
    </para>
    <!-- Note: on HP, split groups have the same ID, but different
               names. -->
    <para>
      This feature (split group) permits to limit the length of lines in
      the group file. This is useful to make sure that lines for NIS
      groups are not larger than 1024 characters.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you need to enforce such limit, you can use 25.
    </para>
    <para>
      Note: split groups may not be supported by all tools (even in the
      Shadow toolsuite). You should not use this variable unless you really
      need it.
