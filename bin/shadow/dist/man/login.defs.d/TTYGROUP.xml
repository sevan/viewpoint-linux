      The terminal permissions: the login tty will be owned by the
      <option>TTYGROUP</option> group, and the permissions will be set to
      <option>TTYPERM</option>.
    </para>
    <para>
      By default, the ownership of the terminal is set to the user's
      primary group and the permissions are set to
      <replaceable>0600</replaceable>.
    </para>
    <para>
      <option>TTYGROUP</option> can be either the name of a group or a
      numeric group identifier.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you have a <command>write</command> program which is "setgid" to
      a special group which owns the terminals, define TTYGROUP to the
      group number and TTYPERM to 0620.  Otherwise leave TTYGROUP
      commented out and assign TTYPERM to either 622 or 600.
