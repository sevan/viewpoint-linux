    <para>
      This parameter specifies which values in the <emphasis
      remap='I'>gecos</emphasis> field of the
      <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> file may be changed by regular
      users using the <command>chfn</command> program. It can be any
      combination of letters <replaceable>f</replaceable>,
      <replaceable>r</replaceable>, <replaceable>w</replaceable>,
      <replaceable>h</replaceable>, for Full name, Room number, Work
      phone, and Home phone, respectively. For backward compatibility,
      <replaceable>yes</replaceable> is equivalent to
      <replaceable>rwh</replaceable> and <replaceable>no</replaceable> is
      equivalent to <replaceable>frwh</replaceable>. If not specified,
      only the superuser can make any changes. The most restrictive
      setting is better achieved by not installing <command>chfn</command>
      SUID.
