      If <replaceable>yes</replaceable>, the location of the user tcb
      directory to be created will not be automatically set to /etc/tcb/user,
      but will be computed depending on the UID of the user, according to
      the following algorithm:
      <programlisting>
if ( UID is less than 1000) {
  use /etc/tcb/user
} else if ( UID is less than 1000000) {
  kilos = UID / 1000
  use /etc/tcb/:kilos/user
  make symlink /etc/tcb/user to the above directory
} else {
  megas = UID / 1000000
  kilos = ( UID / megas * 1000000 ) / 1000
  use /etc/tcb/:megas/:kilos/user
  make symlink /etc/tcb/user to the above directory
}
      </programlisting>
