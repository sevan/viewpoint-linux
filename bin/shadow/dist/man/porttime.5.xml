    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
    <para>
      <emphasis remap='I'>porttime</emphasis> contains a list of tty
      devices, user names, and permitted login times.
    </para>

    <para>
      Each entry consists of three colon separated fields. The first field
      is a comma separated list of tty devices, or an asterisk to indicate
      that all tty devices are matched by this entry. The second field is a
      comma separated list of user names, or an asterisk to indicated that
      all user names are matched by this entry. The third field is a comma
      separated list of permitted access times.
    </para>

    <para>
      Each access time entry consists of zero or more days of the week,
      abbreviated <emphasis>Su</emphasis>, <emphasis>Mo</emphasis>,
      <emphasis>Tu</emphasis>, <emphasis>We</emphasis>,
      <emphasis>Th</emphasis>, <emphasis>Fr</emphasis>, and
      <emphasis>Sa</emphasis>, followed by a pair of times separated by a
      hyphen. The abbreviation <emphasis>Wk</emphasis> may be used to
      represent Monday thru Friday, and <emphasis>Al</emphasis> may be used
      to indicate every day. If no days are given, <emphasis>Al</emphasis>
      is assumed.

    <title>EXAMPLES</title>
    <para>
      The following entry allows access to user <emphasis
      remap='B'>jfh</emphasis> on every port during weekdays from 9am to
      5pm.
    </para>

    <para>	*:jfh:Wk0900-1700</para>

    <para>
      The following entries allow access only to the users
      <emphasis>root</emphasis> and <emphasis>oper</emphasis> on
      <filename>/dev/console</filename> at any time. This illustrates how
      the <filename>/etc/porttime</filename> file is an ordered list of
      access times. Any other user would match the second entry which does
      not permit access at any time.
