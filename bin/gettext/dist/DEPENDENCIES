The following packages should be installed before GNU gettext is installed
(runtime dependencies that are also build dependencies):

* GNU libiconv
  + Not needed on systems with
      - glibc 2.2 or newer, or
      - MacOS X 10.3 or newer, or
      - NetBSD 3.0 or newer.
    But highly recommended on all other systems.
    Needed for character set conversion of PO files from/to Unicode
    and for the iconv_ostream class of libtextstyle.

  + If it is installed in a nonstandard directory, pass the option
    --with-libiconv-prefix=DIR to 'configure'.

* GNU ncurses (preferred)
  or libtermcap (discouraged) or a curses library (legacy).
  + Highly recommended.
    Needed for styling of terminal output (libtextstyle and the --color
    option of the 'msgcat' program).

    --with-ncurses-prefix=DIR or --with-libtermcap-prefix to 'configure'.

* libxml2
  + Recommended.
    Needed for 'xgettext' and 'msgfmt', so that it can parse XML
    files.  Also needed for the --color option of the various
    programs.
    If not present, a subset of libxml2 (included in this package) will be
    compiled into libgettextlib.
