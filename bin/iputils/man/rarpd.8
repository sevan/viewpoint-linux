.SH "NAME"
rarpd \- answer RARP REQUESTs
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBrarpd\fR\ 'u
\fBrarpd\fR [\fB\-AadevV\fR] [\fB\-b\ \fR\fB\fIbootdir\fR\fR] {interface}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Listens for RARP requests broadcasted by clients\&. If the MAC address of the client is found in
/etc/ethers
and the obtained hostname is resolvable to a valid IP address from the attached network,
\fBrarpd\fR
answers to the client with a RARPD reply and provides an IP address\&.
.PP
To allow multiple boot servers on the network
\fBrarpd\fR
optionally checks if a Sun\-like bootable image in the TFTP directory is present\&. It should be formatted like
\fBHexadecimal_IP\&.ARCH\fR\&. For example: To load sparc 193\&.233\&.7\&.98,
\fIC1E90762\&.SUN4M\fR
is linked to an image appropriate for SUN4M in the directory
/etc/tftpboot\&.
.SH "WARNING"
.PP
This facility is deeply obsoleted by BOOTP and later DHCP protocols\&. However, some clients actually still need this to boot\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-a\fR
.RS 4
Listen on all available interfaces\&. Currently it is an internal option, its function is overwritten with the
\fIinterface\fR
argument\&. It should not be used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-A\fR
.RS 4
Listen not only to RARP but also ARP messages\&. Some rare clients use ARP for some unknown reason\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v\fR
.RS 4
Be verbose\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-d\fR
.RS 4
Debug mode\&. Do not go to background\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-e\fR
.RS 4
Do not check for the presence of a boot image\&. Reply if MAC address resolves to a valid IP address using
/etc/ethers
database and DNS\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-b\fR \fIbootdir\fR
.RS 4
TFTP boot directory\&. Default is
/etc/tftpboot
.RE
.PP
\fB\-V\fR
.RS 4
Print version and exit\&.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP

\fBtftpd\fR(8)\&.
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
\fBrarpd\fR
was written by Alexey Kuznetsov <kuznet@ms2\&.inr\&.ac\&.ru>\&.
.SH "SECURITY"
.PP
\fBrarpd\fR
requires CAP_NET_RAW capability to listen and send RARP and ARP packets\&. It also needs CAP_NET_ADMIN to assist the kernel with ARP resolution; this is not strictly required, but some (to be more exact: most) of the clients are so badly broken that they are not able to answer to ARP before they are fully booted\&. This is no surprise, taking into account that clients using RARPD in 2002 are all unsupported relic creatures of the 90\*(Aqs and even earlier\&.
.SH "AVAILABILITY"
.PP
\fBrarpd\fR
is part of the
\fIiputils\fR
package\&.
