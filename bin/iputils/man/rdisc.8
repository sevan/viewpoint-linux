.SH "NAME"
rdisc \- network router discovery daemon
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBrdisc\fR\ 'u
\fBrdisc\fR [\fB\-abdfrstvV\fR] [\fB\-p\ \fR\fB\fIpreference\fR\fR] [\fB\-T\ \fR\fB\fImax_interval\fR\fR] [send_address] [receive_address]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBrdisc\fR
implements client side of the ICMP Internet Router Discovery Protocol (IRDP)\&.
\fBrdisc\fR
is invoked at boot time to populate the network routing tables with default routes\&.
.PP
\fBrdisc\fR
listens on the ALL_HOSTS (224\&.0\&.0\&.1) multicast address (or
\fIreceive_address\fR
if it is provided) for ROUTER_ADVERTISE messages from routers\&. The received messages are handled by first ignoring those listed router addresses with which the host does not share a network\&. Among the remaining addresses the ones with the highest preference are selected as default routers and a default route is entered in the kernel routing table for each one of them\&.
.PP
Optionally,
\fBrdisc\fR
can avoid waiting for routers to announce themselves by sending out a few ROUTER_SOLICITATION messages to the ALL_ROUTERS (224\&.0\&.0\&.2) multicast address (or
\fIsend_address\fR
if it is provided) when it is started\&.
.PP
A timer is associated with each router address and the address will no longer be considered for inclusion in the routing tables if the timer expires before a new
\fBadvertise\fR
message is received from the router\&. The address will also be excluded from consideration if the received
\fBadvertise\fR
message has a preference of maximum negative\&.
.PP
Server side of router discovery protocol is supported by Cisco IOS and by any more or less complete UNIX routing daemon, for example
\fBgated\fR\&. If compiled with ENABLE_RDISC_SERVER,
\fBrdisc\fR
can act as responder\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-a\fR
.RS 4
Accept all routers independently of the preference they have in their
\fBadvertise\fR
messages\&. Normally
\fBrdisc\fR
only accepts (and enters in the kernel routing tables) the router or routers with the highest preference\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-b\fR
.RS 4
Opposite to
\fB\-a\fR, i\&.e\&. install only router with the best preference value\&. This is the default behaviour\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-d\fR
.RS 4
Send debugging messages to syslog\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-f\fR
.RS 4
Keep
\fBrdisc\fR
running in the background even if no routers are found\&. Normally
\fBrdisc\fR
gives up if it has not received any
\fBadvertise\fR
message after soliciting three times\&. In this case it exits with a non\-zero exit code\&. If
\fB\-f\fR
is not specified in the first form then
\fB\-s\fR
must be specified\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-r\fR
.RS 4
Responder mode, available only if compiled with ENABLE_RDISC_SERVER\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s\fR
.RS 4
Send three
\fBsolicitation\fR
messages initially to quickly discover the routers when the system is booted\&. When
\fB\-s\fR
is specified
\fBrdisc\fR
exits with a non\-zero exit code if it can not find any routers\&. This can be overridden with the
\fB\-f\fR
option\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p\fR \fIpreference\fR
.RS 4
Set preference in advertisement messages\&. Available only with \-r option\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-T\fR \fImax_interval\fR
.RS 4
Set maximum advertisement interval in seconds\&. Default is 600\&. Available only with \-r option\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-t\fR
.RS 4
Test mode\&. Do not go to background\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v\fR
.RS 4
Be verbose and send lots of debugging messages to syslog\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-V\fR
.RS 4
Print version and exit\&.

.SH "SECURITY"
.PP
\fBrdisc\fR
requires CAP_NET_RAW to listen and send ICMP messages and capability CAP_NET_ADMIN to update routing tables\&.

is part of
\fIiputils\fR
package\&.
