.SH NAME
sa2 \- Create a report from the current standard system activity daily data file.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B @SA_LIB_DIR@/sa2

.SH DESCRIPTION
.RB "The " "sa2 " "command is a shell procedure variant of the " "sar"
command which writes a daily report in the
.IR "sarDD " "or the " "sarYYYYMMDD " "file, where"
.IR "YYYY " "stands for the current year, " "MM " "for the current month and " "DD"
for the current day. By default the report is saved in the
.I @SA_DIR@
directory. The
.B sa2
command will also remove reports more than one week old by default.
You can however keep reports for a longer (or a shorter) period by setting the
.B HISTORY
environment variable. Read the
.BR "sysstat" "(5) manual page for details."

.RB "The " "sa2 " "command accepts most of the flags and parameters of the " "sar " "command."

.SH EXAMPLES

command daily, place the following entry in your root crontab file:

.B 5 19 * * 1-5 @SA_LIB_DIR@/sa2 -A

directory, where the
.IR "DD " "parameter is a number representing the day of the month."
