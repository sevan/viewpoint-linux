.SH NAME
sa1 \- Collect and store binary data in the system activity daily data file.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B @SA_LIB_DIR@/sa1 [ --boot | --rotate [ iso ] | --sleep |
.I interval count
.B ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.RB "The " "sa1"
.RB "command is a shell procedure variant of the " "sadc"
command and handles all of the flags and parameters of that command. The
.B sa1
command collects and stores binary data in the current standard
system activity daily data file.
.PP
The standard system activity daily data file is named
.IR "saDD " "unless"
.BR "sadc" "'s option " "-D " "is used, in which case its name is"
.IR "saYYYYMMDD" ","
.RI "where " "YYYY " "stands for the current year, " "MM " "for the current month and " "DD"
for the current day. By default it is located in the
.I @SA_DIR@
directory.
.PP
.RI "The " "interval " "and " "count"
parameters specify that the record should be written
.IR "count " "times at " "interval"
seconds. If no arguments are given to
.B sa1
then a single record is written.

The
.B sa1
command is designed to be started automatically by the
.BR "cron " "command."

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B --boot
This option tells
.BR "sa1 " "that the " "sadc"
command should be called without specifying the
.IR "interval " "and " "count"
parameters in order to insert a dummy record, marking the time when the counters
restart from 0.
.TP
.B --rotate [ iso ]
.RB "Use this option to tell " "sa1 " "to insert a record of statistics to the standard"
.IR "saDD" " system activity daily data file of the previous day."
This should be done shortly after midnight (on day DD+1) in order to make sure that the
data file covers the whole day, including the last interval of time just before midnight.
.RB "Adding the " "iso" " keyword tells " "sa1" " to use
.IR "saYYYYMMDD" " instead of " "saDD" " as the standard system activity daily data file name."
.TP
.B --sleep
.RB "This option tells " "sa1 " "that the " "sadc"
command should insert a comment indicating that the system is entering or leaving
sleep mode (i.e. system suspend or hibernation).

.SH EXAMPLE
To collect data (including those from disks) every 10 minutes,
place the following entry in your root crontab file:

.B 0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * @SA_LIB_DIR@/sa1 1 1 -S DISK

To rotate current system activity daily data file, ensuring it is complete,
place the following entry in your root crontab file:
