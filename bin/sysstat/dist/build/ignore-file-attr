Here again, don't bother too much with that. When set, this parameter prevents
the installation process from setting the attributes (eg. user, group...) of
files being installed.
For example, when this parameter is used, the contents of the man_group variable
won't be taken into account, the installation process won't try to set the
user and group attributes of the /var/log/sa directory...
This parameter is only used by some distros to package sysstat.
