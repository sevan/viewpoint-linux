Answer y if you want sadc to collect all possible activities. This is
equivalent to passing option "-S XALL" to sadc, and as a consequence
all optional activities are collected (read sadc(8) manual page to
knwow which activities are optional).
Default answer is n: Optional activities are NOT collected to prevent
data files from growing too large.
