	maint: automate creation of release tag
	The gnulib makefile was already set up to automate things with
	'make release ...', but we were still doing things by hand, and
	thereby risking missing some steps.

	* m4/gnulib-cache.m4 (gl_MODULES): Import do-release-commit-and-tag.
	* gnulib: Update, for latest version of the script.
	* HACKING: Mention its use.

	maint: generate ChangeLog from git commits
	Follow the practice set in numerous other GNU projects, where
	the ChangeLog (since 2015) is generated from git commit messages.
	This avoids duplication or subtle differences between the two,
	as well as making it easier to merge patches across branches
	(as good as Bruno Haible's 'git-merge-changelog' helper program
	is, it still doesn't handle cross-branch cherry-picks very well).

	* ChangeLog: Move...
	* ChangeLog-2014: ...to this.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Ship renamed file.
	(gen-ChangeLog): New rule, copied mostly from coreutils.
	(dist-hook): Generate the ChangeLog.
	* m4/gnulib-cache.m4 (gl_MODULES): Import gitlog-to-changelog.
	* .gitignore: Ignore ChangeLog.
	* .gitattributes: Likewise.
	* HACKING: Reword to match new procedure, and simplify by
	referring to an external description of ChangeLog style.

	maint: summarize highlights of pending release
	* NEWS: Add some blurbs.

	maint: make silent builds the default
	The user still has full control over verbosity levels, both setting
	their per-project defaults at configure time (or even in a config.site
	file), as well as a per-run override. But these days, most projects
	are defaulting to silent rules without user intervention.

	* configure.ac (AM_SILENT_RULES): Add, to match what most projects
	are doing these days.

	maint: release no longer creates a diff file
	Ever since commit f1cf390 (1.4.14 release), we no longer create
	diff files as part of the release process.  These days, it is
	assumed that it is easier to download a fresh tarball rather
	than to try and use a diff file to patch an older tarball.

	doc: drop obsolete @setcontentsaftertitlepage
	texinfo 6.1 complains (during 'make dvi'):

	/home/eblake/m4-1.4/doc/./m4.texi:9: @setcontentsaftertitlepage has been remove
	d as a Texinfo command; move your @contents command if you want the contents af
	ter the title page..

	It turns out that eliminating the command has no effect - modern
	tools correctly emit the contents in-place, right after the title
	page, so it was leftover cruft from an older time.

	* doc/m4.texi: Satisfy newer texinfo.

2016-12-29  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	build: update to latest gnulib
	I hit a weird failure during 'make check', and traced it to a recent
	gnulib regression in parallel test safety.  Pick up the gnulib fix.

	* gnulib: Update to latest, to fix failure in getopt tests.

2016-12-29  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	maint: regenerate bootstrap
	Missed during the copyright update.

	* bootstrap: Regenerate.

2016-12-29  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	maint: bump copyright year
	Sadly, there's no commit in 2015, which means we don't get to benefit
	from using a copyright range.

	Done with 'make update-copyright'.

	* all files: Version control now has a commit in 2016.

2016-12-29  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	gnulib: Update to latest
	* gnulib: Update to latest.
	* m4/gnulib-cache.m4: Regenerate.
	* src/macro.c (expand_macro): Deal with obstack API change.
	* src/builtin.c (mkstemp_helper): Likewise.
