Subject: Re: gawk for OS/2 - any updates?

Hello Arnold,

I'd like to inform you about the current state of compiling gawk on
OS/2:

1. Compilation

Running ./configure does work but

- I tried only running with --disable-nls, so with NLS I didn't test.
- Depending on the gcc version you use you may get linker errors. In
  that case add 'CFLAGS=-O2 -g -fgnu89-inline' to the configure options
  (-O2 -g already is the default).


2. Tests

It is possible to run the built-in checks but many test results depend
on the shell being used. I recommend to use 'make -i check' to run
the tests because some failures might cause a immediate termination
of the make run.

- If your shell uses \r\n linebreaks (in that case all tests fail)
  then you have to run 'make -i check CMP=diff' to ignore the linebreak
  differences at the test result comparison.
- Depending on the shell some tests might just hang forever. Press
  Ctrl+C and/or Ctrl+Break until the tests continue.
- OS/2 can only load DLLs with filenames up to 8+3 bytes but gawk
  creates three internal DLLs with longer names (e.g. filefuncs.dll,
  revoutput.dll, revtwoway.dll). Thus, all tests trying to load
  filefuncs.dll or the other two DLLs will fail. This is not a bug
  of gawk. If you change e.g. the '@load filefuncs' directive to
  '@load filefunc' in the according *.awk file then the tests will
  succeed.
- The number of failling tests is currently around 50, less if your
  shell uses \r\n linebreaks, more otherwise.

Best wishes,

Andreas Buening

Fixes for loading extension libraries have since been included
in the git repo and will be part of 4.2.1.
