Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Fabian Kreutz
        Many math pages had their synopses compressed, as per suggestion
        from Fabian Kreutz.

Various pages
    Fabian Kreutz / aeb
        Many minor content and formatting bug fixes were made to the math
        pages, following suggestions from Fabian Kreutz (who recently
        translated many of the 1.70 math pages into German) and
        Andries Brouwer.

Various pages
    mtk
        For consistency, all instances of "super-user" were changed
        to the more common "superuser".

Various pages
    Vasya Pupkin / mtk
        After a note from Vasya Pupkin, I added <errno.h> to the SYNOPSIS
        of several Section 2 pages using the _syscallN() macros.

        In addition:
            -- erroneous semicolons at the end of _syscallN() were removed
               on various pages.

            -- types such as "uint" in syscallN() declarations were changed
               to "unsigned int", etc.

            -- various other minor breakages in the synopses were fixed.

        The affected pages are:

                getdents.2
                gettid.2
                llseek.2
                mmap2.2
                modify_ldt.2
                pivot_root.2
                quotactl.2
                readdir.2
                sysctl.2
                syslog.2
                tkill.2

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
other places.

initgroups.3
mkstemp.3

readdir.3
telldir.3
    Matthew Dempsky, mtk
        triggered by http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=283179
        The wording describing how errno is set was fixed up in these pages.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
other places.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

sendfile.2
    mtk
        Adjusted descriptions of argument file types to be closer to
        2.6 reality.
        Wording and formatting changes.

ctan.3
ctanh.3
    Tony Crawford
        As per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=270817
        Formulae on the pages should be T = S / C not T = C / S.

errno.3
    Martin Schulze, mtk
        Removed errno declaration from prototype, added notes
        on historical need for this declaration.
        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=174175

aio_return.3
    as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=224953
        Changed erroneous "aio_return(2)" to "aio_return(3)".

posix_openpt.3
    mtk
        New by mtk

ptsname.3
    mtk
        Added description of ptsname_r().
        Added ERRORS.

ptsname_r.3
    mtk
        New link to ptsname.3.

shm_open.3
    Matthew Gregan
        add <fcntl.h> to synopsis
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=271243

strcasecmp.3
    Marek Habersack
            .SH "CONFORMING TO"
            -BSD 4.4
            +BSD 4.4, SUSv3
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=234443

strfry.3
    Joshua Kwan
        Added _GNU_SOURCE to prototype
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=213538

strftime.3
    Cartsen Hey
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=276248

        Changed range for "%S" from 0..61 to 0..60.

        SUSv3 says 0..60.  I think the manual page probably says
        0..61, because that's what SUSv2 said.
        (Some other implementations' man pages also say 0..61 --
        e.g., Solaris 8 & 9, Tru64 5.1B; FreeBSD 5.1 says 0..60.)

        The glibc manual currently says 0..60.

        Given that SUSv3 says 0..60, I've changed the
        manual page to also say this:

            -The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 61).
            +The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 60).
            +(The range is up to 60 to allow for occasional leap seconds.)

sysconf.3
    Johannes Berg
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=226974
        -.BR POSIX2_FORT_RUN " - " _SC_2_FORT_DEV
        +.BR POSIX2_FORT_DEV " - " _SC_2_FORT_DEV

system.3
    Pedro Zorzenon
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=242638
        Noted use of _XOPEN_SOURCE to get macros from <stdlib.h>
        for wait(2).

    mtk
        Changed name of argument from 'string' to 'command' (like POSIX).

        Noted that glibc does nowadays explicitly check for the existence
        of the shell if 'command' is NULL, rather than the older behavior
        of assuming the shell exists and always returning 1 if
        'command' is NULL.

        Other wording and formatting clean-ups.

undocumented.3
    Remove some functions names that *are* documented.

    Martin (Joey) Schulze
        Removed SEE ALSO reference to nonexistent newctime(3).
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=236884

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
other places.

Changes to individual pages

epoll_create.2
    Marko Kohtala  / mtk
        Improved various error descriptions.

epoll_wait.2
    David Lloyd / Mike Frysinger, Marko Kohtala
        Added EINTR to errors.

fcntl.2
    Jamie Lokier / mtk
        Improved discussion of F_SETOWN and F_SETSIG with respect to
        multi-threaded programs.
        Generally cleaned up the discussion of F_SETOWN.

        Updated CONFORMING TO to note that F_GETOWN and F_SETOWN are
        now in POSIX.

link.2
    mtk
        Noted discrepancy between Linux and POSIX.1 when oldpath
        is a symbolic link.
        See: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=367
        and: http://www.opengroup.org/austin/mailarchives/ag/msg08152.html

    Michael Haardt / mtk
        Clarified EXDEV error description: it isn't possible to link
        across mount points, even if the mount points refer to the same
        file system.

mincore.2
    mtk, after note from Gordon Jin
        Updated ERRORS.

pipe.2
    As per message from Serguei Leontiev
        Removed SVr2, AT&T, and BSD from CONFORMING TO, since
        a pipe on those systems is actually bidirectional.
        (Pipes are implemented as STREAMS on the former, and
        sockets on the latter.)

posix_fadvise.2
    mtk
        Noted kernel version where posix_fadvise() appeared and
        noted bug in handling of 'len' in kernels < 2.6.6.

        the same file system.

semop.2
    mtk
        Noted kernel version numbers for semtimedop().

    Johan Walles, Martin (Joey) Schulze
        Added sigqueue.2 to SEE ALSO.

times.2
    mtk
        Added notes on non-standard behavior: Linux allows 'buf' to
        be NULL, but POSIX.1 doesn't specify this and it's non-portable.

uselib.2
    Andries Brouwer
        Improved DESCRIPTION; clarified distinction between
        EACCES and ENOEXEC.

bcopy.3
    Heikki Orsila
        bcopy() handles overlapping case, but memcpy() does not,
        so for consistency memmove() should be also mentioned.

getmntent_r.3
    Martin (Joey) Schulze
        New link to man3/getmntent.3.

memcpy.3
    Small wording change after suggestion from Sasa Stevanovic.

        Improved description of read from /dev/urandom.

st.4
    Kai Makisara
        Substantial updates.

==================== Changes in man-pages-2.10 ====================

Released: 2005-10-19

Global changes
--------------

The changes in this release consist *solely* of formatting fixes, with
the aim bringing greater consistency to the manual pages according to
the following rules:

-- Function name references should *always* be followed by
   parentheses, "()" (possibly containing a manual page section
   number).

-- The parentheses following a function name should *not* be
   formatted.  Thus, for example, instead of:

       .B name()

   one should write:

       .BR name ()

Much of the change was automated using two scripts:
add_parens_for_own_funcs.sh and unformat_parens.sh.
For the (possible) benefit of downstream manual page maintainers and
translators, I have placed these scripts in a new subdirectory 'scripts'.

NOTE THE FOLLOWING POINTS WELL:

-- These scripts provide a computer-assisted solution to the above
   two goals.  However, they are not perfect, and their output should
   be scanned by a human.  (To see what changes the two scripts
   *would* make, without making them, use the "-n" command line option.)

-- The scripts do not fix all instances that violate the above rules:
   some manual fixes are required.  Two further scripts are provided
   to help find remaining instances of function names without
   following "()": find_dots_no_parens.sh and find_slashes_no_parens.sh.

The following changes were made:

-- add_parens_for_own_funcs.sh was applied to the pages in Sections
   2 and 3.

-- unformat_parens.sh was applied to pages in Sections 2, 3, 4, and 7
   (the only sections where such changes were required).

-- further changes (not so very many) were performed by hand.
   (found places to fix with the assistance of find_dots_no_parens.sh
   and find_slashes_no_parens.sh).

Various pages
    mtk
        Most instances of the constant "NULL" are not formatted (bolded) in
        man pages, but a few are.  For consistency, formatting on "NULL" has
        been removed where it occurred.

        Many minor formatting fixes were made.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

getrlimit.2
    mtk
        Added EINVAL error for rlim_cur > rlim_max when calling setrlimit().

        Repaired discussion of capabilities and file system UID, which
        mistakenly had involved exec() in the discussion.

prctl.2
    mtk
        Removed text saying there is no library interface.  There
        is nowadays.

mkfifo.3
    mtk

        sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE) can be used.

path_resolution.2
    mtk / aeb
        Removed words "as well" (added in 2.11) from the phrase
        "and it gets these last five capabilities if its fsuid is 0 as well"
        since there are (unusual) situations in which fsuid can be 0 while
        the effective UID is not.

        Reworked (cut down) discussion of capabilities, moving part of
        it into capabilities.7

setresuid.2
    mtk
        Add text to note that setresuid() always modifies the file
        system UID, and setresgid() likewise always modifies the file
        system GID.

        Added (brief) description of SHM_HUGETLB.

sigaltstack.2
    mtk / Martin Landers

    Brian M. Carlson  / herbert
        Change <netinet/in.h> to <arpa/inet.h> in prototype; add text
        explaining that some systems need the former header.
        As per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=265244

capabilities.7
    mtk
        Reworked part of the discussion of exec() and capabilities.
        Added sub-section "Effect of User ID Changes on Capabilities".
        Reworked discussion of CAP_SYS_ADMIN and file-max.


==================== Changes in man-pages-2.13 ====================

Released: 2005-11-03

This release consists entirely of formatting and typographical fixes.

Global changes
--------------

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.

Various pages
    mtk
        Function and page cross references that were italicized were
        made bold (which is how the majority of function and page
        cross references were already done).

Various pages
    mtk
        Instances of things like "NULL-terminated string" were changed to
        "null-terminated string".

Various pages
    mtk
        Pathnames, structures, arguments, and <header-files> that were
        bold were changed to italics.

Various pages
    mtk
        Instances of the constant "NULL" that were bold-faced were made
        unformatted (which is how most instances of "NULL" were already
        formatted.)

Global changes
--------------

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.

New pages
---------

rexec.3
    mtk / Justin Pryzby
        This page is taken as is from the FreeBSD 5.4 distribution.
        (Not checked against Linux reality, but likely things are
        the same.)
        See also http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=336875

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

arch_prctl.2
    mtk
        Updated discussion about lack of prototype in glibc.

execve.2
    mtk
        Improved description of E2BIG error: it relates to the sum
        of the bytes in both environment and argument list.

fcntl.2
    mtk
        Clarified parts of the discussion of file leases,
        noting effect of open(O_NONBLOCK), interruption
        by signal handler, or termination by signal in
        lease breaker.  In response to
        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=339037

stat.2
    mtk / Stefan Brüns
        Added LINUX NOTES describing nanosecond timestamps.

frexp.3
    Volker Reichelt / mtk
        Fixed to point out that frexp() returns a number whose
        *absolute* value is >= 0.5 and < 1.  Amended the example
        program to demonstrate this.

open.2
    mtk / Avery Pennarun
        Add EWOULDBLOCK error for file leases.
        In response to
        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=339037

putenv.3
    mtk
        Although the glibc implementation returns -1 on error (and some
        other man pages (e.g., the BSDs) also document that value for
        error returns), SUSv3 merely says "non-zero" (and this is
        what manual pages on many implementations also say).

posix_memalign.3
    mtk
        Formerly, the page said that all systems declare memalign() in
        <malloc.h>.  In fact, many declare it in <stdlib.h>.

strtok.3
    mtk
        Almost a complete rewrite after Angelo pointed out
        that the existing page was deficient.

sd.4
    Martin Schulze
        Remove SEE ALSO for nonexistent scsi.4.

proc.5
    mtk
        Updated discussion of /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max.

signal.7
    mtk
        Added pthreads.7 to SEE ALSO.

Global changes
--------------

Most pages
    mtk
        There was a major reworking of the CONFORMING TO sections
        in most manual pages.

        * generally try to rationalize the names used for standards.
          The preferred names are now documented as the head words
          of the list in standards(7).  For the future: there is
          probably no need to talk about anything more than
          C89, C99, POSIX.1-2001 (or later), xBSD, and SVr4.
          (In particular, I've eliminated most references to XPG
          and SVID, replacing them with references to SUS or SVr4.)

        * eliminate discussion of errors that can occur on other
          systems.  This information exists only patchily in the
          manual pages, is probably of limited use, is hard to maintain,
          and was in some cases simply wrong (and probably always was).

        * Tried to ensure that those interfaces specified in C99 or
          POSIX.1-2001 are marked as such in their manual pages.

intro.1
intro.2
intro.3
intro.4
intro.5

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several

rtc.4
    David Brownell

        Update the RTC man page to reflect the new RTC class framework:

        - Generalize ... it's not just for PC/AT style RTCs, and there
          may be more than one RTC per system.

        - Not all RTCs expose the same feature set as PC/AT ones; most
          of these ioctls will be rejected by some RTCs.

        - Be explicit about when {A,P}IE_{ON,OFF} calls are needed.

        - Describe the parameter to the get/set epoch request; correct
          the description of the get/set frequency parameter.

        - Document RTC_WKALM_{RD,SET}, which don't need AIE_{ON,OFF} and
          which support longer alarm periods.

        - Hey, not all system clock implementations count timer irqs any
          more now that the new RT-derived clock support is merging.

places.  (Special thanks to Nicolas François!)


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

access.2
    mtk
        Since 2.6.20, access() honors the MS_NOEXEC mount flag.
    Jorge Peixoto de Morais Neto / mtk
        Improve ENOENT description.

clone.2
    mtk
        Added some detail to the prototype.
        Added some notes on IA-64's clone2().

epoll_ctl.2
    mtk
        Add text to note that EPOLLRDHUP appeared in kernel 2.6.17.

faccessat.2
    Justin Pryzby
        Various fixes as per
        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=411177
        * s/effective/real/ in description text.
        * added <fcntl.h> to synopsis.
        * various other changes.

getrlimit.2
    mtk / Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
        Added a few words to note that RLIMIT_NPROC is really a limit on
        threads.

io_cancel.2
io_destroy.2
io_getevents.2
io_setup.2
io_submit.2
    Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
        s%linux/aio.h%libaio.h% in SYNOPSIS.
        Changed return type from "long" to "int".

mbind.2
    Samuel Thibault / mtk
        Fix EINVAL description.
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=411777

mincore.2
    Nick Piggin
        Kernel 2.6.21 fixes several earlier bugs in mincore().
    Nick Pollitt
        Remove words "of a file" -- mincore() is describing
        memory residence information, not properties of a file.
    mtk
        Rewrote various parts to make the page clearer.

mmap.2
    mtk
        Rewrote and reorganized various parts to be clearer.
    Taken from Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
        Removed text stating that mmap() never returns 0; that's
        not true.

mount.2
    mtk / Val Henson
        Document MS_RELATIME, new in Linux 2.6.20.

open.2
    Andre Majorel / mtk
        On Linux, the error returned when opening a large file on a
        32-bit system is actually EFBIG, not EOVERFLOW.

posix_fadvise.2
    Pádraig Brady
        Fix RETURN VALUE description: returns error number of failure.

rename.2
    mtk / Timo Sirainen
        Various improvements to DESCRIPTION.
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=416012

semop.2
    mtk
        If sops contains multiple operations, then these are performed
        in array order.  All Unix systems that I know of do this,
        and some Linux applications depend on this behavior.  SUSv3
        made no explicit statement here, but SUSv4 will explicitly
        require this behavior.
        Small rewording of explanation of "atomically".

signal.2
    Nicolas François
        Fix incorrect argument name in DESCRIPTION.
    mtk
        Small wording improvement.

socket.2
    Nicolas François
        Add reference to ipv6.7 page.

socketcall.2
    Nicolas François
        Fix .TH line.

splice.2
    Benjamin Gilbert
        Fix inconsistent argument names in SYNOPSIS and DESCRIPTION.

statvfs.2
    mtk
        Small wording clarification.

symlink.2
    mtk / Nicolas François
        Removed cryptic text under CONFORMING to referring to
        "open(2) and NFS".  There is no relevant text in open.2 as
        far as I (mtk) can see.

time.2
    mtk / Reuben Thomas
        Remove sentence "gettimeofday() obsoleting time() on 4.3BSD".
        This information is old, and probably no longer relevant.
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=403888

write.2
    mtk, after an idea from a downstream Fedora patch.
        Clarified discussion of /count == 0/ case.

ptrace.2
    Chuck Ebbert
        When the parent receives an event with PTRACE_EVENT_* set,
        the child is not in the normal signal delivery path.  This
        means the parent cannot do ptrace(PTRACE_CONT) with a signal
        or ptrace(PTRACE_KILL).  kill() with a SIGKILL signal can be
        used instead to kill the child process after receiving one
        of these messages.

sched_setaffinity.2
    mtk
        Fix glibc version number in description of 'cpusetsize' argument.

vfork.2
    mtk
        Stripped some excess/outdated text from the BUGS section.

basename.3
    mtk / Jorge Peixoto de Morais Neto
        Add text to clarify that the pointer returned by these
        functions may be into some part of 'path'.

dlopen.3
    Taken from Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
    + Carlo Marcelo Arenas Belon
        Add "#include <stdlib.h>" to example program.

fclose.3
    mtk
        Complete rewrite.  The existing page was hard to read,
        and the RETURN VALUE description seems to be wrong.

getopt.3
    mtk
        Added getopt() example program.
    mtk
        Add a few words to clarify the operation of the GNU-specific
        double-colon feature, which allows options to have optional
        arguments.
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=352139

glob.3
    Nicolas François
        Fix PROTOTYPE.

inet_network.3
    mtk, after an idea from a downstream Fedora patch.
        Clarified description of inet_network().

log.3
    Nicolas François
        Fix .TH line.

log10.3
    Nicolas François
        Fix .TH line.

malloc.3
    Nicolas François
        Small rewording to mention calloc().

posix_openpt.3
    Martín Ferrari
        Fix return type in SYNOPSIS; as per
        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=400971
        Needs _XOPEN_SOURCE == 600; as per
        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=400975
    Julien BLACHE
        s/ptsname/posix_openpt/ in RETURN VALUE

re_comp.3
    Taken from Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
        Add "#define _REGEX_RE_COMP" to SYNOPSIS.

regex.3
    Nicolas François
        Fix .TH line.

termios.3
    mtk
        Added .SS headers to give some structure to this page; and a small
        amount of reordering.
    mtk
        Added a section on canonical and non-canonical mode.
    mtk
        Enhanced the discussion of "raw" mode for cfmakeraw().
    mtk
        Document CMSPAR.
    mtk
        Make description of PARODD a little clearer.
    Reuben Thomas
        Add SEE ALSO link to tty_ioctl.4
    mtk
        Add SEE ALSO link to console_ioctl.4

ualarm.3
    mtk
        Removed BSD prototype from synopsis.
        Various rewordings.

usleep.3
    mtk
        Removed BSD prototype from synopsis.
        Various rewordings.

    Taken from Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
        s/curses/ncurses/ under SEE ALSO

bootparam.7
    Taken from Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
        Documented "mem=nopentium".

feature_test_macros.7
    mtk
        The default treatment of _POSIX_C_SOURCE changed in glibc 2.4.
    mtk, after a suggestion by Justin Pryzby
        Added some text warning that the "__" macros that
        <features.h> defines internally should never be
        directly defined by programs.
    mtk, based on notes by Jakub Jelinek
        Document _FORTIFY_SOURCE
        (See http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2004-09/msg02055.html )
    mtk
        Document _REENTRANT and _THREAD_SAFE.

mdoc.7
    mtk / Nicolas François
        Remove CONFIGURATION section, since this does not seem to be
        true for Linux.

svipc.7
    Nicolas François
        Fix data types in associated data structures;
        remove nonexistent semzcnt and semncnt fields.

time.7
    mtk
        Since kernel 2.6.20, the software clock can also be 300 HZ.

        Bug filed (http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8408)

==================== Changes in man-pages-2.50 ====================

Released: 2007-05-21

Contributors
------------

The following people contributed notes, ideas, or patches that have
been incorporated in changes in this release:

Andreas Halter <halter@google.com>
Laird Shaw <netocrat@dodo.com.au>
Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>

Apologies if I missed anyone!

Removed pages (!)
-----------------

Most Section 1 man pages are removed
    mtk (with help from Mike Frysinger, Laird Shaw, Andreas Halter)
        Once upon time Andries added a number of Section 1 manual pages
        to man-pages.  However, since that time, those pages have not
        seen much maintenance, and are not in fact distributed in most
        distributions.  Instead most distributions supply the
        coreutils versions of these pages, which are currently
        maintained.  In addition, man-pages provides the 1p pages,
        which document the portable subset of functionality of these
        commands.  Since the man1 pages are mostly unneeded, and
        out of date, I'm removing them.  The following pages disappear:

            chgrp.1
            chmod.1
            chown.1
            cp.1
            dd.1
            df.1
            diff.1
            dir.1
            dircolors.1
            du.1
            install.1
            ln.1
            ls.1
            mkdir.1
            mkfifo.1
            mknod.1
            mv.1
            rm.1
            rmdir.1
            touch.1
            vdir.1

        The following Section 1 pages will be kept:

            intro.1
            ldd.1
            time.1


==================== Changes in man-pages-2.51 ====================

Released: 2007-05-28

Global changes
--------------

Various pages

        Convert function formatting of the form "\fBname\fP()" to
        ".BR name ()".

==================== Changes in man-pages-2.52 ====================

Released: 2007-05-29

    "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by
     little statesmen and philosophers and divines"

        Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882)

    "But damn it, these man pages are a mess!"

        Reason: consistency.

Various pages
    mtk
        Some .SH header lines were made into .SS lines.  (One of the aims
        here is to reduce the number of non-standard .SH lines.)

Various pages
    mtk
        Change title .SH sections named "NOTE" to "NOTES", in some cases
        also changing the location of the section within the page.
        Reason: consistency.

Various pages
    mtk
        Commented out .SH AUTHOR sections; the right place for
        documentation authorship sections is usually comments at the
        top of the page source.

Various pages
    mtk
        Changed .SH HISTORY to .SH VERSIONS.
        Reason: in many cases, HISTORY was being used to describe
        Linux/glibc version information, as was already done for
        VERSIONS sections in other pages.

Various pages
    mtk
        Removed HISTORY section, or moved it as a subsection or paragraphs
        under another section e.g., NOTES.
        Reason: there are too many arbitrary section (.SH) names, and
        a HISTORY section never was consistently used across Linux
        manual pages.

Various pages
    mtk
        Moved SEE ALSO section to be last section on the page
        Reason: consistency -- and this is where SEE ALSO should be!

Various pages
    mtk
        Relocated GLIBC NOTES as subsection under NOTES
        Reason: reduce number of arbitrary section (.SH) names.

Various pages
    mtk
        Relocated LINUX NOTES as subsection under NOTES
        Reason: reduce number of arbitrary section (.SH) names.

Various pages
    mtk
        Renamed some "AVAILABILITY" sections to "VERSIONS".
        Reason: consistency.

Various pages
    mtk
        Renamed some "DIAGNOSTICS" sections to "RETURN VALUE".
        Reason: consistency.

getopt.3
tzselect.8
    mtk
        s/\.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES/.SH ENVIRONMENT/
        Reason: consistency.

intro.2
select.2
sysctl.2

getgrent_r.3
getgrouplist.3
getpwent_r.3

strptime.3
tsearch.3
vcs.4
wordexp.3
    mtk
        s/return 0/exit(EXIT_FAILURE)/ in main() of function example
        program.
        Reason: consistency.

mprotect.2
select_tut.2
dlopen.3
getgrent_r.3
getopt.3
getpwent_r.3
hsearch.3
select_tut.2
tsearch.3
    mtk
        Use symbolic constants (EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_FAILURE) in calls
        to exit().
        Reason: consistency.

access.2
chown.2
lseek.2
open.2
read.2
utmp.5
    mtk
        Renamed RESTRICTIONS section to NOTES, or moved text in a
        RESTRICTIONS section under existing NOTES section.
        Reason: consistency, and reduce number of arbitrary section (.SH)
        names.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

capget.2
    mtk
        s/\.SH FURTHER INFORMATION/.SH NOTES/

dup.2
    mtk
        s/\.SH WARNING/.SH NOTES/

kill.2
    mtk
        Renamed LINUX HISTORY section to LINUX NOTES, and relocated
        within page.

select_tut.2
    mtk
        Relocated example program and made its .SH title "EXAMPLE".

sigaltstack.2
    mtk
        Move code example into its own EXAMPLE section.

sigreturn.2
    mtk
        s/\.SH WARNING/.SH NOTES/

setuid.2
    mtk
        s/\.SH "LINUX-SPECIFIC REMARKS"/.SH LINUX NOTES/

shmget.2
    mtk
        Remove section about effect of fork()/exec()/exit(); shmop.2
        contains the same text, and it only needs to be said once.

shmop.2
    mtk
        Minor rewording under DESCRIPTION.

daemon.3
    mtk
        Minor wording and formatting changes.

encrypt.3
    mtk
        Removed statement that glibc unconditionally exposes declarations
        of encrypt() and setkey(), since portable applications must
        use <unistd.h> and define _XOPEN_SOURCE to obtain the declarations
        of setkey() and encrypt().  Adjusted example program accordingly.

mkstemp.3
    mtk
        Slight rewording.

LDP.7
    mtk
        Minor wording and formatting changes.

man.7
    mtk
        Substantial rewrite, revising and extending the discussion
        about desired conventions for writing pages.
        There will be further updates to this page in the next few
        man-pages releases.


==================== Changes in man-pages-2.53 ====================

Released: 2007-05-30

    "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by
     little statesmen and philosophers and divines"

        Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882)

    "But damn it, these man pages are a mess!"


Global changes
--------------

Many many pages
    mtk
        Reordered sections to be more consistent, in some cases renaming
        sections or shifting paragraphs between sections.

man7/*
    mtk
        In various pages in this section, .SH headings were
        converted to .SS.


==================== Changes in man-pages-2.54 ====================

The following people contributed notes, ideas, or patches that have
been incorporated in changes in this release:

Emmanuel Mogenet <emogenet@google.com>
Michael Berg <michaeljberg@gmail.com>

Apologies if I missed anyone!


Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    mtk
        Where there is an instruction in the SYNOPSIS about linking
        or compiling with a certain option, the option is now
        marked up in italics (e.g., "\fI-lm\fP").

Various pages
    mtk
        Added page numbers to page cross references.

A few pages
    mtk
        s/manpage/man page/, for consistency.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.


New pages
---------

man-pages.7
    mtk
        A description of the conventions that should be followed
        when writing pages for the man-pages package.

Removed pages
-------------

man1/README
    mtk
        Already deleted most of the man1 pages previously, so
        this doesn't need to stay.

LDP.7
    mtk
        Removed this page since it is out of date, and the proper place
        to go for up-to-date information is http://www.tldp.org/

ksoftirq.9
    mtk
        Reason: this was the only Section 9 page, and it is old
        (Linux 2.4).  The man9 section never took off as an idea, and
        I see little point in keeping a Section 9 with just a single
        old page.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

HOWTOHELP
    mtk
        Moved some material out of here into new man-pages.7.

alloc_hugepages.2
    mtk
        Minor rewrites, eliminating some duplication, and removing
        some outdated text.

epoll_pwait.2
    Michael Berg
        Fix broken link path;
        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=425570

fcntl.2
    mtk
        Remove misleading text about setting O_ASYNC when calling
        open(); one must use fcntl() F_SETFL for this task.

fdatasync.2
    mtk
        Converted outdated BUGS note about fdatasync() being
        equivalent to fsync() on Linux 2.2 into a NOTES note
        about this historical behavior.

futex.2
    mtk
        Small rewording to fix "fails with the error EWOULDBLOCK"
        rather than "returns EWOULDBLOCK".
        See Red Hat bug 172828.

mprotect.2
    mtk, after an observation by Emmanuel Mogenet
        A much improved example program.
    mtk
        Significant rewrites and additions to description.

        much information, in my opinion.

sched_yield.2
    mtk
        Added ERRORS section.

set_mempolicy.2
    mtk
        Moved text for "Versions and Library Support".

set_tid_address.2
    mtk
        Small rewording in RETURN VALUE section.

sigaction.2
    mtk
        Add EXAMPLE section with a pointer to example in mprotect.2.

        Rewrite and substantial additional text.

exec.3
    mtk
        Minor clarifications for text on execlp() and execvp().  Removed
        FILES section, since it provides no useful additional info.

fenv.3
    mtk
        Moved link instructions from NOTES to SYNOPSIS.
        Added feenableexcept, fedisableexcept, fegetexcept
        to .SH NAME list.

fputwc.3
    mtk
        Added 'putwc' to .SH NAME list.

gethostbyname.3
    mtk
        s/int/socklen_t/ for type of gethostbyaddr() 'len' argument,
        and add a few more words in NOTES about the type used here.

login.3
    mtk
        Removed remark from NOTES about linking with -lutil; add
        text on that point to SYNOPSIS.

openpty.3
    mtk
        Removed redundant remark from NOTES about linking with -lutil
        since there is text on that point under SYNOPSIS.

sysconf.3
    mtk
        Added SEE ALSO referring to getconf(1).

unlocked_stdio.3
    mtk
        Revised .SH NAME section.

ascii.7
    mtk
        Minor rearrangement of order of text.

capabilities.7
    mtk
        s/exec()/execve(2)/ in various places.

complex.7
    mtk
        Changed "atan(1)" to "atan(1.0)" to prevent some versions of
        man2html(1) from mistaking that string as a page cross reference.

rtnetlink.7
    mtk
        Small restructuring to avoid 'cannot adjust line' from man(1).

ldconfig.8
    mtk
        Removed now very out-of-date sentence about need to link shared
        libraries with -lc.

man.7
    mtk
        Various text was moved out of this page into the new man-pages.7.

mdoc.7
    mtk
        Added SEE ALSO referring to new man-pages.7.

mdoc.samples.7
    mtk
        A few changes, hopefully done right, to eliminate some
        errors to stderr when rendering with man(1).

rtnetlink.7
    mtk
        Shorten a line in table so it fits in 80 columns.
        Minor rewording under BUGS.

tzselect.8
    mtk
        Moved EXIT STATUS section.

        have gone away,

Several pages
    mtk
        Change reference to path_resolution.2 to path_resolution.7.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.


Moved pages
-----------

path_resolution.2 has been moved to section 7, thus path_resolution.7
    mtk
        Reason: this is an overview page, not one describing as
        a specific system call.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

        Added pointer to Red Hat man-pages bugzilla.

==================== Changes in man-pages-2.56 ====================

Released: 2007-06-11

Global changes
--------------

Many pages
    mtk
        Removed version numbers in .TH lines.
        Reason: these were only arbitrarily updated, and so impart no
        useful information.  Version information goes into a
        VERSIONS section nowadays, and the date in the .TH line should
        be updated to reflect the date of the last (significant)
        change to the page.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.

==================== Changes in man-pages-2.59 ====================

Released: 2007-06-25

Global changes
--------------

Manual pages are now standardized on American spelling.  See
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences
for more information on the differences.  Formerly, different pages (and
sometimes even a single page!) employed American and British spelling
conventions; best to standardize on one spelling, and American English
is the standard in Computer Science.

New pages
---------

sgetmask.2
    mtk
        A real man page for sgetmask(2) and ssetmask(2).
        (This page replaces a previous link of the same name, which
        linked to signal.2.)

spu_create.2
    Arnd Bergmann with additional work by Eduardo M. Fleury and mtk
        Document the PowerPC SPU spu_create() system call.
        (Originally taken from the kernel source file
        Documentation/filesystems/spufs.txt.)

        Document the PowerPC SPU spu_run() system call.

Removed Pages
-------------

__clone.2
    mtk
        This file was created by accident in 2.61, as a copy of clone.2.
        (it should have been a link to clone.2.)

obsolete.2
    mtk
        Details on this page are covered in syscalls.2 and in
        respective syscall man pages (stat.2, uname.2).

undocumented.2
    mtk
        This page is very out of date, and in any case difficult
        to maintain.  Information about undocumented system calls
        is maintained in the HOWTOHELP file, and probably in other
        places soon.

killpg.3
    mtk
        This rather incomplete page seems unnecessary since there
        is a killpg.2.

    mtk
        Update SYNOPSIS to reflect the fact that fchmod(2) and lchown(2)
        need either "#define _XOPEN_SOURCE 500" or "#define _BSD_SOURCE".
        Added an example program.

killpg.2
    mtk
        Note that killpg() is actually a library function on Linux.

mmap.2
    mtk
        Added note that glibc mmap() wrapper nowadays invokes mmap2().

mmap2.2
    Ivana Varekova / mtk
        On most platforms the unit for 'offset' is 4096 bytes, not
        the system page size.

        top of sigtimedwait().

ssetmask.2
    mtk
        Make this link point to new sgetmask.2 instead of signal.2.

stat.2
    mtk
        Add notes on the different system call interfaces that
        have appeared over time.

syscalls.2
    mtk
        A fairly substantial rewrite of this page,
        bringing it up to date with the current
        kernel version, and listing all system calls

    mtk
        Add notes on the different system call interfaces that

        Add section numbers to function names; remove some functions
        since they are documented.

proc.5
    mtk
        Update/correct text on /proc/malloc.
    mtk, after a note by Pierre Habouzit, and a few comments by Justin Pryzby
        Update description of /proc/PID/stat to match 2.6.21.
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=417933

inotify.7
    mtk
        IN_DONT_FOLLOW and IN_ONLYDIR are only available from 2.6.15.

    Stepan Kasal / mtk
        Note SIGRTMIN value depends on glibc.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

mq_notify.2
mq_open.2
mq_timedreceive.2
mq_timedsend.2
mq_unlink.2
    mtk
        Fix broken link

setpgid.2
    mtk
        Fairly substantial changes and corrections, including adding
        coverage of all of the interfaces that get/set PGIDs.

syscalls.2
    mtk / aeb
        Various rewordings; clear up some imprecisions.

lgamma.3
    mtk
        Added 'signgam' to SYNOPSIS and NAME line.

strerror.3
    mtk
        Note that the XPG version is provided since glibc 2.3.4.
        The page formerly said that the GNU-specific version
        is provided by default.  That certainly isn't true
        nowadays, since _POSIX_C_SOURCE is set to 200112L by
        default, so that the XSI-compliant version is supplied
        by default.

man-pages.7
    mtk
        Added note pointing to feature_test_macros.7 for a description
        of how feature test macro requirements should be specified in
        manual pages.  Various other minor fixes and changes.

feature_test_macros.7
    mtk
        Added note about how feature test macros are specified
        in manual pages.
        Many other corrections, improvements, additions, and
        details about differences across glibc versions.

--------------

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.

Various pages
    mtk
        Use 'glibc' consistently to refer to GNU C library.

Various pages
    mtk
        Order errors under ERRORS alphabetically.

Various pages
    Nicolas François
        Spelling and formatting fixes, as per
        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=439560

intro.2
select.2
fmtmsg.3
getgrent_r.3
envz_add.3
rtime.3
strptime.3
wordexp.3
    Maxime Vaudequin
        Add "#include <stdlib.h>" (to declare exit(3)) to example program.


New pages
---------

timeradd.3
    mtk
        Description of timeradd(), timersub(), timerclear(),
        timerisset(), timercmp() macros for operating on
        struct timeval.


Removed pages
-------------

fdatasync.2
    mtk
        Somehow, over time, material on fdatasync(2) crept into
        fsync.2, and fdatasync also got added to the NAME section
        of fsync.2.  All of the material in fdatasync.2 that was
        not already in fsync.2 has now been moved there, and
        the former page has been removed.
        In place of the content there, is now a link to fsync.2.


New links
---------

clock_getres.2
clock_gettime.2
clock_settime.2
    mtk
        Link to man3/clock_getres.3.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

Makefile
    Mike Frysinger
        Make the install target of man-pages respect the standard
        "DESTDIR" variable as well as check the exit status of the
        install command so errors aren't ignored.

get_mempolicy.2
    Lee Schermerhorn
        changed the "policy" parameter to "mode" through out the
        descriptions in an attempt to promote the concept that the memory
        policy is a tuple consisting of a mode and optional set of nodes.

        added requirement to link '-lnuma' to synopsis

        rewrite portions of description for clarification.

        added all errors currently returned by sys call.

        removed cautionary note that use of MPOL_F_NODE|MPOL_F_ADDR
        is not supported.  This is no longer true.

        added mmap(2) to SEE ALSO list.

getitimer.2
    mtk
        Since kernel 2.6.22, Linux setitimer() now conforms to POSIX.1,
        giving an EINVAL error for a non-canonical tv_usec value.

gettimeofday.2
    mtk
        Replace discussion of timer* macros with a pointer
        to new page timeradd.3.

ioctl_list.2
    Nicolas George
        Fixed argument type for BLKGETSIZE.

mbind.2
    Lee Schermerhorn

        changed the "policy" parameter to "mode" throughout the
        descriptions in an attempt to promote the concept that the memory
        policy is a tuple consisting of a mode and optional set of nodes.

        rewrite portions of description for clarification.

            clarify interaction of policy with mmap()'d files and shared
            memory regions, including SHM_HUGE regions.

            defined how "empty set of nodes" specified and what this
            means for MPOL_PREFERRED.

            mention what happens if local/target node contains no
            free memory.

            clarify semantics of multiple nodes to BIND policy.
            Note:  subject to change.  We'll fix the man pages when/if
                   this happens.

        added all errors currently returned by sys call.

        added mmap(2), shmget(2), shmat(2) to SEE ALSO list.

mprotect.2
    François Diakhate
        Add text noting that PROT_WRITE may (and on x86 does)

    mtk
        Removed SEE ALSO reference to nonexistent fadvise.2.

reboot.2
    mtk
        Place SYNOPSIS comments inside C comments (/* ... */).

sched_setaffinity.2
    Samuel Thibault
        Note what thread is affected if 'pid' is specified
        as 0, or as the value returned by getpid().

sched_setscheduler.2
    Carsten Emde
        Add text on real-time features of mainline Linux kernel.

select_tut.2
    mtk
        sync SYNOPSIS with select.2

set_mempolicy.2
    Lee Schermerhorn

        changed the "policy" parameter to "mode" throughout the
        descriptions in an attempt to promote the concept that the memory
        policy is a tuple consisting of a mode and optional set of nodes.

        added requirement to link '-lnuma' to synopsis

        rewrite portions of description for clarification.

            clarify interaction of policy with mmap()'d files.

            free memory.

            clarify semantics of multiple nodes to BIND policy.
            Note:  subject to change.  We'll fix the man pages when/if
                   this happens.

        added all errors currently returned by sys call.

        added mmap(2) to SEE ALSO list.

    mtk
        Improve description of num_threads field under /proc/PID/stat.
    Maxime Vaudequin
        Fix path error (s%proc/sys%proc/sys/kernel%) in mentions of
        /proc/sys/ostype, /proc/sys/osrelease and proc/sys/version.
    Maxime Vaudequin
        I noticed things to correct and to clarify in subsection
        "/proc/filesystems" of proc.5:
        - clarify filesystems listing: not only FS compiled
          into the kernel, also FS kernel modules currently loaded
        - add a reference to fs(5)
        - add an explanation for FS marked with "nodev"
        - s/mount(1)/mount(8)/, also corrected in section "SEE ALSO"
        - clarify usage by mount: the current wording may lead to
          think /proc/filesystems is always used by mount when no FS
          is specified. So, usage of "may" which IMHO is more
          appropriate + additional explanations
          In mount(8) we can see:

               If no -t option is given, or if the auto type is
               specified, mount will try to guess the desired type.
               If mount was compiled with the blkid library, the
               guessing is done by this library. Otherwise, mount
               guesses itself by probing the superblock; if that
               does not turn up anything that looks familiar,
               mount will try to read the file /etc/filesystems,
               or, if that does not exist, /proc/filesystems.
               All of the filesystem types listed there will be
               tried, except for those that are labeled "nodev"
               (e.g., devpts, proc and nfs). If /etc/filesystems
               ends in a line with a single * only, mount will
               read /proc/filesystems afterwards.
    Samuel Thibault
        Since linux 2.6.11, /proc/stat has an eighth value for cpu
        lines: stolen time, which is the time spent in other operating
        systems when running in a virtualized environment.

arp.7
        Updated BUGS text referring to jiffies; refer to time.7 instead.

credentials.7
    mtk
        Add words to note that file system ID is Linux specific.

hier.7
    Maxime Vaudequin
        This is some corrections for hier.7:
        - missing period for /media and /mnt
        - /mnt description is not totally correct, it is true for some
          distributions but in others /mnt is used as a temporary FS
          mount point, as it is specified by FHS:
          http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html#MNTMOUNTPOINTFORATEMPORARILYMOUNT
        - s/X-Windows/X-Window/ (3 occurrences)
        - section "SEE ALSO": s/mount(1)/mount(8)/

man-pages.7
man.7
mdoc.7
mdoc.samples.7
    mtk / Nicolas François
        Nowadays tmac.XXX are called XXX.tmac.

pthreads.7
    mtk
        Update text about modern threading implementations
        (NPTL vs LinuxThreads).

socket.7
    mtk, after a note by Andi Kleen
        Clarify that SO_SNDTIMEO and SO_RCVTIMEO only have effect for
        socket I/O calls; not for multiplexing system calls like
        select() and poll().

time.7
    mtk
        Add SEE ALSO reference to new timeradd.3.

Global changes

*.1p
*.3p
    mtk, after a note by Andi Kleen and consultation with Andrew Josey.
        Add a PROLOG section:
            This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.
            The Linux implementation of this interface may differ
            (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details
            of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented
            on Linux.

*.0p
*.1p
*.3p
    mtk
        Some formatting fixes, mostly to get rid of unwanted
        spaces before "," in formatted output.

*
*/*
    mtk
        Change all occurrences of my email address in man-pages source
        to my new gmail address.

Many many pages
    Maxime Vaudequin
        I noticed useless use of macros with alternating formatting
        (".IR" instead ".I" which suffices, ".BR" instead ".B", etc.)
        because there is only one element.  For example in ldconfig.8:

            -.BR /sbin/ldconfig
            +.B /sbin/ldconfig

        This is not very important, it only makes the sources more tidy.
        To find these I used:

            egrep '^\.(B[RI]|R[IB]|I[RB]) ([^ ]+|\"[^\"]\+\")$'

        And if you want to make these changes, you can use:

            sed 's/^\(\.[BRI]\)[BRI]\( \([^ ]\+\|\"[^\"]\+\"\)\)$/\1\2/g'

        s/stdlib.h/fcntl.h/ in SYNOPSIS.

proc.5
    Fernando Luis Vázquez Cao
        Update /proc/[number]/cmdline description.
        It used to be true that the command line arguments were
        not accessible when the process had been swapped out.
        In ancient kernels (circa 2.0.*) the problem was that the
        kernel relied on get_phys_addr to access the user space buffer,
        which stopped working as soon as the process was swapped out.
        Recent kernels use get_user_pages for the same purpose and thus
        they should not have that limitation.

epoll.7
    Davide Libenzi / mtk
        Clarify the somewhat unintuitive behavior that occurs if a file
        descriptor in an epoll set is closed while other file descriptors
        referring to the same underlying open file description remain
        open.
        See also http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/596462/.
    mtk
        Clarify error that occurs if we add an epoll fd to its own set.
    mtk
        A few minor rewordings.
    mtk, after a note by Chris Heath
        Rework Q1/A1, describing what happens when adding the same
        file descriptor twice to an epoll set, and when adding duplicate
        file descriptors to the same epoll set.
    Heikki Orsila / mtk / Davide Libenzi
        Clarify Q9/A9 to discuss packet/token-oriented files.
    mtk, after comments by Davide Libenzi and Chris Heath
        Added Q0/A0, making explicit that the key for items in an epoll
        set is [file descriptor, open file description].
    mtk, after a note by Ron Burk
        Change A3, to note that when events are available,
        the epoll file descriptor will indicate as being readable.
    mtk
        Add some further explanation to Q5/A5 about why an epoll file
        descriptor cannot be passed across a Unix domain socket.

posixoptions.7
    mtk
        Add SEE ALSO entry for standards(7).

regex.7
    mtk
        Add grep(1) to SEE ALSO.
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=348552.

standards.7
    mtk
        Add SEE ALSO entry for posixoptions(7).

time.7
    mtk
        Added SEE ALSO entry referring to timerfd_create.2.

fork.2
    mtk
        NOTES: since glibc 2.3.3, the glibc NPTL fork() wrapper
        bypasses the fork() system call to invoke clone() with
        flags providing equivalent functionality.

        more generic.
    mtk
        SEE ALSO: add chown(2) and chmod(2).

poll.2
    mtk

    mtk
        s/posix_madvise (2)/posix_madvise (3)/;
        (The referred-to page still doesn't exist yet, but hopefully
        will do sometime soon.)

ptrace.2

        always change *both* timestamps).
        CONFORMING TO: utimes() is in POSIX.1-2001.
    mtk
        Rename 'buf' argument of utime() to 'times' (like utimes()).
        Clarify explanation of EACCES and EPERM errors.

        information.
        Clarified discussion of capabilities, and noted that
        CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE also has a role.
        Other minor rewordings.

wait.2
    mtk, after a note by Justin Pryzby
        Add a sentence clarifying that even though the default disposition

        SIG_IGN results in different treatment of zombies.

aio_cancel.3
aio_error.3
aio_fsync.3

aio_return.3
aio_suspend.3
aio_write.3
    Kevin O'Gorman <kogorman@csc.calpoly.edu>

backtrace.3
    Nicolas François
        s/backtrace_symbols/backtrace_symbols_fd/ in one sentence.
    mtk
        Fix bogus reference to variable 'strings': should be:
        "the array of pointers".

ctime.3
    mtk
        Add warning under NOTES that asctime(), ctime(), gmtime(), and
        localtime() may each overwrite the static object returned by any
        of the other calls.
        Other minor edits.

dlopen.3
    mtk
        Add more detail to the description of the fields in the
        structure returned by dladdr().

fexecve.3
    mtk
        Clean up SYNOPSIS after work by cut-and-paste-Pete:
        the necessary header file is <unistd.h> not <sys/time.h>!

        Add documentation of lutimes(), which appeared in glibc 2.6.
    mtk
        Change description in NAME line ("or" is not correct: these calls

        CONFORMING TO: futimes() did not come from 4.2BSD.  (It came from
        FreeBSD; see the FreeBSD man page.)

getenv.3
    mtk
        Noted that caller must not modify returned value string.
        Noted that getenv() is not reentrant: the buffer may be statically

        setenv(), or unsetenv().
        Other minor rewrites.

getgrent.3
    Petter Reinholdtsen
        SEE ALSO: Add getgrouplist(3).
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=479284.

malloc.3
    mtk
        RETURN VALUE: Note circumstances in which successful malloc() and
        calloc() can return NULL.

mq_open.3
    mtk, after a note by Marty Leisner
        Note that <fcntl.h> is needed for O_* constants and <sys/stat.h>
        is needed for 'mode' constants.

opendir.3
    mtk
        Describe treatment of close-on-exec flag by opendir() and
        fdopendir().

openpty.3
    mtk

raise.3
    mtk / Timothy Baldwin
        Clarify semantics of raise() when called from a multithreaded

        Remove outdated warning in NOTES; encourage the use of
        random(3) instead.
    Folkert van Heusden
        Clarify wording describing range of values returned by rand().

random.3
    aeb / mtk / Tolga Dalman
        Recommend use or random_r(3) for multithreaded applications
        that need independent, reproducible sequences of random numbers.

        Move references to "The Art of Computer Programming" and
        "Numerical Recipes", formerly in rand(3), to this page.

        Add drand48(93) to SEE ALSO list.

regex.3
    Heikki Orsila
        Clarify description of 'rm_eo' field.

sem_open.3
    mtk, after a note by Marty Leisner
        Note that <fcntl.h> is needed for O_* constants and <sys/stat.h> is
        needed for 'mode' constants.

sem_post.3
    mtk
        Added pointer to example in sem_wait(3).

sem_close.3
sem_destroy.3
sem_getvalue.3
sem_init.3

sem_wait.3
    mtk, after a note from Marty Leisner
        Add text to SYNOPSIS noting the need to link with "-lrt" or
        "-pthread".

setenv.3
    mtk
        setenv() copies 'name' and 'value' (contrast with putenv()).
        unsetenv() of a nonexistent variable does nothing and is
        considered successful.
        Noted that setenv() and unsetenv() need not be reentrant.

shm_open.3
    mtk, after a note by Marty Leisner
        Note that <fcntl.h> is needed for O_* constants and <sys/stat.h> is
        needed for 'mode' constants.

undocumented.3
    mtk
        initstate_r(3), setkey_r(3), setstate_r(3) are now documented.

utmp.5
    Nicolas François
        Small rewording.

resolv.conf.5
    Nicolas François
        gethostname() is in Section 2, not section 3.

ascii.7
    Stuart Brady
        Fix rendering of ' (backtick) and apostrophe (') in tables

charsets.7
    Nicolas François
        s/unicode.com/unicode.org/

credentials.7
    mtk
        NOTES: Pthreads requires that all threads share the same UIDs and
        GIDs.  But the Linux kernel maintains separate UIDs and GIDs for
        every thread.  NPTL does some work to ensure that credential
        changes by any thread are carried through to all POSIX threads in
        a process.
    mtk
        sysconf(_SC_NGROUPS_MAX) can be used to determine the number of
        supplementary groups that a process may belong to.
        Clarify that supplementary group IDs are specified in POSIX.1-2001.

epoll.7
    mtk, after a note from Sam Varshavchik
        For answer A2, change "not recommended" to "careful programming
        may be required".

inotify.7
    mtk
        Document SIGIO feature (new in 2.6.25) for inotify file descriptors.
    mtk
        Note that select()/poll()/epoll_wait() indicate a ready inotify
        file descriptor as readable.
    mtk
        Document IN_ATTRIB in a little more detail.

==================== Changes in man-pages-3.00 ====================

The following people contributed notes, ideas, or patches that have
been incorporated in changes in this release:

Andries Brouwer <Andries.Brouwer@cwi.nl>
Stuart Brady <sdbrady@ntlworld.com>

Apologies if I missed anyone!


Global changes
--------------

The POSIX.1 man pages (sections 0p, 1p, 3p) have been moved out
of this package into the separate man-pages-posix package.
This made sense because those pages are seldom changed (only formatting
fixes, etc.) so that it was unnecessary to redistribute them with each
man-pages release.


console_codes.4
random.4
dir_colors.5
proc.5
glob.7
    Stuart Brady
        s/`/\`/ for backquotes used in command substitution, for
        proper rendering in UTF-8.

Various pages
    mtk, after a note from Stuart Brady
        Using /'x'/ to denote a character (string) renders poorly in
        UTF-8, where the two ' characters render as closing single
        quotes.  On the other hand, using /`x'/ renders nicely on UTF-8,
        where proper opening and closing single quotes are produced by
        groff(1), but looks ugly when rendered in ASCII.  Using the
        sequence /\\aqx\\aq/ produces a reasonable rendering ('\\aq'
        is a vertical "apostrophe quote") in both UTF-8 and ASCII.
        So that change is made in a number of pages.
        See also http://www.cl.cal.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/quotes.html.

Various pages
    mtk
        Replace form /`string'/ by /"string"/, since the former renders
        poorly in ASCII.

termios.3
console_codes.4
tty_ioctl.4
termcap.5
charsets.7
    mtk
        Control character names (^X) are written boldface, without
        quotes.

printf.3
scanf.3
proc.5
glob.7
regex.7
    mtk
        Various edits to try and bring some consistency to the use of
        quotes.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

tty_ioctl.4
    mtk
        Small rewordings in description of packet mode.

locale.7
    mtk
        Minor formatting fixes.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

acct.2
    mtk
        Add a few more words to DESCRIPTION.
        NOTES: Add pointer to acct(5).

alarm.2
    Alain Portal
        s/process/calling process/ so as to say that the alarm signal is
        delivered to the calling process.

brk.2
    Yao Zhao / mtk
        Clarify discussion of return value of sbrk().
    mtk
        DESCRIPTION: Add some sentences giving an overview of these
        interfaces.
        Add note recommending use of malloc(3).
        Change name of brk() argument to the simpler 'addr'.
        Add "(void *)" cast to "-1" for error return of sbrk().
        Removed some incorrect text about "brk(0)".
        Note that SUSv2 specified the return value of sbrk().
        Added a detail on the glibc brk() wrapper.
        Remove discussions of old standards (C89 and POSIX.1-1990);
        CONFORMING TO already discusses the situation with respect
        to more recent standards.

chmod.2
    mtk
        Clarify description of chmod() and fchmod().
        Add further detail on S_ISUID, S_ISGID, and S_ISVTX permissions.
        Reformat list of permissions bits.

chown.2
    mtk
        Describe rules governing ownership of new files (bsdgroups
        versus sysvgroups, and the effect of the parent directory's
        set-group-ID permission bit).

chroot.2
    Alain Portal
        Clarify description a little.
        s/changes the root directory/
          changes the root directory of the calling process/

execve.2
    mtk
        Fix text that warns against use of NULL argv and envp.
        Using a NULL envp does in fact seem to be portable (works
        on Solaris and FreeBSD), but the Linux semantics for a NULL
        argv certainly aren't consistent with other implementations.
        See http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8408.

getdents.2
    mtk, after a note from George Spelvin
        Document d_type field, present since kernel 2.6.4.
        Other minor edits.

getitimer.2
    mtk
        Noted that POSIX.1 leaves interactions with alarm(), sleep(),
        and usleep() unspecified.
        Linux 2.6.16 removed the MAX_SEC_IN_JIFFIES ceiling on timer
        values.
        Other minor changes.

io_cancel.2
io_destroy.2
io_getevents.2
io_setup.2
io_submit.2
    mtk, after a note by Masatake YAMOTO and input from Jeff Moyer
        Describe the unconventional error return provided by the
        wrapper function in libaio (and contrast with behavior if
        the system call is invoked via syscall(2)).
        See http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ltp/4445/
    Alain Portal / mtk
        Re-order ERRORS and SEE ALSO entries to be alphabetical.

io_getevents.2
    Alain Portal
        Small wording fix.

io_submit.2
    Jeff Moyer
        s/AIO request blocks/AIO control blocks/

mknod.2
    mtk
        Note that EEXIST applies, even if the pathname is a
        (possibly dangling) symbolic link.

nanosleep.2
    mtk, after a report from Stephane Chazelas
        Remove crufty discussion of HZ, and replace with a pointer
        to time(7).
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=485636
    mtk, after some discussions with Bart Van Assche and Roman Zippel
        NOTES: describe CLOCK_REALTIME versus CLOCK_NANOSLEEP
        See also http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/696854/
        "nanosleep() uses CLOCK_MONOTONIC, should be CLOCK_REALTIME?"
    mtk
        Replace mentions of "process' by "thread".
        NOTES: describe case where clock_nanosleep() can be preferable.
        Some minor rewrites.

open.2
    mtk, after a note from Christoph Hellwig
        NOTES: Note that access mode flags are not single bits,
        and document the Linuxism "access mode 3".
        See also http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/653123.

readdir.2
    mtk
        Minor wording fixes.

recv.2
    Alain Portal
        Add comment to 'ee_pad' field in structure definition.

sched_setscheduler.2
    mtk
        Add pointer to discussion of RLIMIT_RTTIME in getrlimit.2.
    mtk, after a note by Andrew Clayton
        Rewrote and restructured various parts of the page for greater
        clarity.
    mtk
        Add more detail to the rules that are applied when an
        unprivileged process with a non-zero RLIMIT_RTPRIO limit
        changes policy and priority.
        SEE ALSO: Add Documentation/scheduler/sched-rt-group.txt

sync_file_range.2
    Pavel Machek
        SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WRITE can block on writes greater than request
        queue size.  For some background, see
        http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/687713/focus=688340

syscalls.2
    mtk
        Added system call history back to version 1.2.
        Fix typo on kernel version for pivot_root().

syslog.2
    WANG Cong
        Document ENOSYS error, which can occur if kernel was built without
        CONFIG_PRINTK.

utime.2
    Nicolas François
        Clarify description of 'times' array for utimes().

adjtime.3
    mtk
        The longstanding bug that if delta was NULL, olddelta
        didn't return the outstanding clock adjustment, is now fixed
        (since glibc 2.8 + kernel 2.6.26).
        http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug?id=2449
        http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6761

dprintf.3
    mtk
        Note that these functions are included in the next POSIX revision.
        Remove editorial discussion about what the functions should have
        been named.

ftime.3

    mtk
        Improve description or 'hints' and 'res' arguments.
        Add details on numeric strings that can be specified for 'node'.
        Other fairly major restructurings and rewrites to improve
        logical structure and clarity of the page.
        SEE ALSO: Add hostname(7).

gethostbyname.3
    mtk
        DESCRIPTION: Add reference to inet_addr(3) for dotted notation.
        SEE ALSO: add inet(3).
    mtk
        Added BUGS section noting that gethostbyname() does not
        recognize hexadecimal components in dotted address strings;
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=482973

getmntent.3
    mtk, after Stuart Cunningham pointed out the typo
        Remove statement that LSB deprecates the functions
        "endmntent(), setmntent() [sic] and setmntent()".
        This doesn't seem to be true (I can't find mention of it
        being deprecated in any of the LSB specs).  Rather, LSB simply
        doesn't specify these functions.  (LSB 1.3 had a spec of
        setmntent(), but not getmntent() or endmntent(), and noted
        that having a spec of setmntent() was of little use without
        also having a spec of getmntent().)
        See also https://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/lsb-discuss/2006-October/003078.html

getnameinfo.3
    Tolga Dalman
        Remove mention of sa_len field from example code.
        That field is a BSDism not present on Linux.
    mtk
        Various minor changes.

inet.3
    mtk / Stephane Chazelas
        inet_aton() is *not* in POSIX.1.
        Rewrote discussion of why inet_addr() is disfavored.
        SEE ALSO: Add getaddrinfo(3).
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=482979.
    mtk, after a note by Stephane Chazelas
        Describe the various address forms supported by inet_aton().
    mtk
        Rewrite description of inet_network().
        Clarify discussion of inet_lnaof(), inet_netof(), and inet_makeaddr().
        Add discussion of Classful Addressing, noting that it is obsolete.
        Added an EXAMPLE program.
    mtk
        Relocate discussion of i386 byte order to NOTES.
        Note that inet_aton() returns an address in network byte order.
        SEE ALSO: Add byteorder(3) and getnameinfo(3).

inet_ntop.3
    mtk
        Remove unneeded header files from SYNOPSIS.
        SEE ALSO: Add inet(3) and getnameinfo(3).
        Make NAME line more precise.
        Move errors to an ERRORS section.
        Add EXAMPLE section pointing to inet_pton(3).

inet_pton.3
    mtk / Stephane Chazelas
        Remove statement that inet_pton() extends inet_ntoa();
        that's not really true, since inet_pton() doesn't support
        all of the string forms that are supported by inet_ntoa().
        SEE ALSO: Add getaddrinfo(3).
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=482987.
    mtk
        Describe IPv6 address formats.
        Describe dotted decimal format in more detail.
        Add an example program.
    mtk
        Remove unneeded header files from SYNOPSIS.
        Make NAME line more precise.
        Make description of return value more precise.
        SEE ALSO: Add inet(3).

mkfifo.3
    mtk
        Note that EEXIST applies, even if the pathname is a
        (possibly dangling) symbolic link.

mkstemp.3
    mtk
        Fix discussion of O_EXCL flag.
        These functions may also fail for any of the errors described
        in open(2).

        Recommend against drem(), in favor of remainder().

scanf.3
    mtk, after a note from Stephane Chazelas
        Add an ERRORS section documenting at least some of the errors
        that may occur for scanf().
        See also http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=487254.
    mtk, after a note from Stephane Chazelas; review by Stephane Chazelas
        Document the GNU 'a' modifier for dynamically allocating strings.
        See also http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=487254.
        Document the GNU 'm' modifier for dynamically allocating strings.

strcat.3

strerror.3
    mtk, after a note from Daniele Giacomini
        Modify SYNOPSIS to show prototypes of both versions of strerror_r(),
        and make other small clarifications of the description regarding
        the two versions.

random.4
    George Spelvin (taking time out from his busy Broadway schedule),
    with some tweaks by Matt Mackall and mtk
        Add a Usage subsection that recommends most users to use
        /dev/urandom, and emphasizes parsimonious usage of
        /dev/random.

Changes to individual pages (math functions)
--------------------------------------------

Almost all of the changes in this release relate to math man pages.
Very many changes were made to the math pages, including:

* Fixed feature test macros (FTMs).  Often, the FTM requirements
  for the "float" and "long double" versions of a math function are
  different from the requirements for the "double" version.  Each math
  page now shows the correct FTM requirements for all three versions
  of the function(s) it describes.  This may have required either
  a change to the existing FTM text (if the requirements for the
  "double" function were already described), or the addition of an FTM
  description to a SYNOPSIS where one was not previously present
  (typically because the "double" version of the function does not
  require any FTMs to be defined).
* CONFORMING TO: in many cases, POSIX.1-2001 was not mentioned.
  Where a function is specified in POSIX.1-2001, this is now noted.
  Also, statements about what other standards a function conforms to
  were generally clarified.  (The wording about which functions conformed
  to C99 was previously often done as an add on sentence; now it is made
  part of the first sentence of the CONFORMING TO section, along with
  POSIX.1-2001.)
* RETURN VALUE: in many cases, pages lacked descriptions of the return
  value when the function arguments are special values such as +0, -0,
  NaN (not-a-number), +infinity, -infinity, etc.  This has been fixed.
  I carried out tests on glibc 2.8 to ensure that all of these
  functions match the RETURN VALUE descriptions (and the POSIX.1-2001
  requirements).
* ERRORS: many pages lacked a clear (or indeed any) description of
  how errno is set on error and what exception is raised for each error.
  This has been fixed.  The ERRORS sections are now generally headed up
  as per the POSIX.1 way of doing things, describing Pole / Range /
  Domain errors, as applicable.
  I carried out tests on glibc 2.8 to ensure that all of these
  functions match the ERRORS descriptions.  Deviations from POSIX.1-2001
  requirements have been filed as glibc bug reports, and noted in the
  man pages.  (The pages now describe the situation for ERRORS as at glibc
  2.8; I may eventually try and extend the text with descriptions of
  changes in older versions of glibc.)
  NOTE: one point that has not been covered in any page is the
  circumstances that generate inexact (FE_INEXACT) exceptions.
  (The details for these exceptions are not specified in POSIX.1-2001,
  and I haven't gone looking for the standards that describe the details.)

scalb.3
    mtk

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

move_pages.2
    Christoph Lameter, various edits and improvements by mtk
        Documentation of the move_pages() system call.
        This page was formerly part of the numactl package, but really
        belongs in man-pages (since it describes a kernel interface).

clock_getcpuclockid.3
    mtk
        New page documenting the clock_getcpuclockid() library function,
        available since glibc 2.2.

udplite.7
    Gerrit Renker
        Document the Linux implementation of the UDP-Lite protocol,
        new in Linux 2.6.20.


Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

proc.5
    Christoph Lameter, minor edits and improvements by mtk
        Documentation of the /proc/PID/numa_maps file.
        This material was formerly the numa_maps.5 page in the numactl
        package, but really belongs in man-pages (since it describes
        a kernel interface).


Global changes
--------------

nanosleep.2
inet_ntop.3
inet_pton.3
scanf.3
initrd.4
    mtk
        Fix mis-ordered (.SH) sections.

connect.2
socket.2
rtnetlink.3
arp.7
ddp.7
ip.7
ipv6.7
netlink.7
packet.7
raw.7
rtnetlink.7
socket.7
tcp.7
udp.7
unix.7
x25.7
    mtk
        s/PF_/AF_/ for socket family constants.  Reasons: the AF_ and
        PF_ constants have always had the same values; there never has
        been a protocol family that had more than one address family,
        and POSIX.1-2001 only specifies the AF_* constants.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
other places.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

execve.2
    mtk
        The floating-point environment is reset to the default
        during an execve().

get_mempolicy.2
    Lee Schermerhorn
        Misc cleanup of get_mempolicy(2):
        + mention that any mode flags will be saved with mode.
          I don't bother to document mode flags here because we
          already have a pointer to set_mempolicy(2) for more info
          on memory policy.  mode flags are discussed there.
        + remove some old, obsolete [IMO] NOTES and 'roff comments.
    Lee Schermerhorn
        Update the get_mempolicy(2) man page to add in the description of
        the MPOL_F_MEMS_ALLOWED flag, added in 2.6.23.
    mtk
        Document additional EINVAL error that occurs is MPOL_F_MEMS_ALLOWED
        is specified with either MPOL_F_ADDR or MPOL_F_NODE.

getitimer.2
    mtk
        CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2008 marks getitimer() and setitimer()
        obsolete.

mbind.2
    Lee Schermerhorn
        Fix error conditions, now that the kernel silently ignores
        nodes outside the task's cpuset, as long as one valid node
        remains.

        Now that cpuset man page exists, we can refer to it.  Remove
        stale comment regarding lack thereof.
    Lee Schermerhorn
        Add brief discussion of mode flags.
    Lee Schermerhorn
        Attempt to clarify discussion of MPOL_DEFAULT.
    mtk
        Fix URI reference for libnuma.

mprotect.2
    mtk / Maxin John
        Remove EFAULT from errors.  Under ENOMEM error, note that
        EFAULT was the error produced in some cases for kernels before
        2.4.19.

msgctl.2
    mtk, after a note from Filippo Santovito
        In the ipc_perm structure definition, some fields were
        incorrectly named: s/key/__key/ and s/seq/__seq/.

set_mempolicy.2
    Lee Schermerhorn
        Fix up the error return for nodemask containing nodes disallowed by
        the process' current cpuset.  Disallowed nodes are now silently ignored,
        as long as the nodemask contains at least one node that is on-line,
        allowed by the process' cpuset and has memory.

        Now that we have a cpuset man page, we can refer to cpusets directly
        in the man page text.

    Lee Schermerhorn
        Another attempt to rationalize description of MPOL_DEFAULT.

        Since ~2.6.25, the system default memory policy is "local allocation".
        MPOL_DEFAULT itself is a request to remove any non-default policy and
        "fall back" to the surrounding context.  Try to say that without delving
        into implementation details.

    Lee Schermerhorn
        Add discussion of mempolicy mode flags to set_mempolicy(2).
        This adds another reason for EINVAL.

setpgid.2
    mtk
        CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2008 marks setpgrp() obsolete.

semctl.2
    mtk, after a note from Filippo Santovito
        In the ipc_perm structure definition, some fields were
        incorrectly named: s/key/__key/ and s/seq/__seq/.

shmctl.2
    Filippo Santovito / mtk
        In the ipc_perm structure definition, some fields were
        incorrectly named: s/key/__key/ and s/seq/__seq/.

utime.2
    mtk
        CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2008 marks utime() obsolete.
        CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2008 removes the POSIX.1-2001 LEGACY
        marking of utimes(), so mention of this point has been
        removed from the page.

vfork.2
    mtk
        CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2008 removes the specification of vfork().

        CONFORMING TO: According to POSIX.1, the behavior of getcwd()
        is unspecified for the buf==NULL case.
    mtk
        Add an introductory paragraph giving an overview of what these
        functions do.
        Fix error in description of getwd(): it does not truncate the
        pathname; rather, it gives an error if the pathname exceeds
        PATH_MAX bytes.
        Rewrote RETURN VALUE section.
        Add EINVAL ENAMETOOLONG errors for getwd().
        Various other clarifications and wording fixes.
        CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2001 does not define any errors for
        getwd().
        CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2008 removes the specification of getwd().

gethostbyname.3

        ensures that "man 5 numa_maps" still works.
        (Eventually, we may want to remove this link.)

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

eventfd.2
    Vijay Kumar
        When an eventfd overflows, select() indicates the file as both
        readable and writable (not as having an exceptional condition).

fcntl.2
    mtk
        F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC is specified in POSIX.1-2008.

getrlimit.2
    mtk
        NOTES: Add text mentioning the shell 'ulimit' (or 'limit')
        built-in command for setting resource limits.

gettimeofday.2
    mtk
        CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2008 marks gettimeofday() as obsolete.

link.2
    mtk
        Note kernel version where Linux stopped following symbolic
        links in 'oldpath'; see also http://lwn.net/Articles/294667.
        POSIX.1-2008 makes it implementation-dependent whether or not
        'oldpath' is dereferenced if it is a symbolic link.
        Add a reference to linkat(2) for an interface that allows
        precise control of the treatment of symbolic links.

mbind.2
    mtk
        Remove material on library support and numactl; that material
        is now in numactl.7.

mmap.2
    mtk
        Add kernel version numbers for MAP_32BIT.
        Add some details on MAP_32BIT (see http://lwn.net/Articles/294642).

open.2
    mtk
        O_CLOEXEC is specified in POSIX.1-2008.

socket.2
    mtk
        s/d/domain/ for name of argument.
        Add reference to socket(2) for further information on
        domain, type, and protocol arguments.

utimensat.2
    mtk
        CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2008 specifies utimensat() and futimens().

dirfd.3
    mtk
        CONFORMING TO: Add POSIX.1-2008; other minor changes.

exec.3
    mtk
        Small rewording: "s/returned/failed with/ [an error]".

fmemopen.3
    mtk
        Since glibc 2.7, it is possible to seek past the end of
        a stream created by open_memstream().  Add a BUGS section
        describing the bug in earlier glibc versions.

gethostbyname.3
    mtk
        Clarify exactly which functions are obsoleted by getnameinfo()
        and getaddrinfo().

getnetent.3
    mtk
        Rephrase description in terms of a database, rather than a file.
        Note that each of the get*() functions opens a connection to
        the database if necessary.
        The database connection is held open between get*() calls if
        'stayopen' is non-zero (not necessarily 1).
        s/zero terminated list/NULL-terminated list/
    mtk
        In glibc 2.2, the type of the 'net' argument for getnetbyaddr()
        changed from 'long' to 'uint32_t'.
    mtk
        Note that the gethostbyaddr() 'net' argument is in host byte order.
    mtk
        RETURN VALUE: emphasize that returned pointer points to a
        statically allocated structure.
        SEE ALSO: add getnetent_r.3.

getprotoent.3
    mtk
        Rephrase description in terms of a database, rather than a file.
        Note that each of the get*() functions opens a connection to
        the database if necessary.
        The database connection is held open between get*() calls if
        'stayopen' is non-zero (not necessarily 1).
        s/zero terminated list/NULL-terminated list/
    mtk
        RETURN VALUE: emphasize that returned pointer points to a
        statically allocated structure.
        SEE ALSO: add getprotoent_r.3.

getrpcent.3
    mtk
        s/rpc/RPC/.
        Rephrase description in terms of a database, rather than a file.
        Note that each of the get*() functions opens a connection to
        the database if necessary.
        s/zero terminated list/NULL-terminated list/
    mtk
        RETURN VALUE: emphasize that returned pointer points to a
        statically allocated structure.
        SEE ALSO: add getrpcent_r.3.

getservent.3
    mtk
        Rephrase description in terms of a database, rather than a file.
        Note that each of the get*() functions opens a connection to
        the database if necessary.
        The database connection is held open between get*() calls if
        'stayopen' is non-zero (not necessarily 1).
        s/zero terminated list/NULL-terminated list/
    mtk
        RETURN VALUE: emphasize that returned pointer points to a
        statically allocated structure.
        SEE ALSO: add getservent_r.3.

mkdtemp.3
    mtk
        CONFORMING TO: this function is specified in POSIX.1-2008.

mq_notify.3
    Venkatesh Srinivas
        s/sigev_notify_function/sigev_thread_function/
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=494956.

realpath.3
    mtk
        Relocate text for resolved_path==NULL case to DESCRIPTION.
        POSIX.1-2001 leaves the resolved_path==NULL case as
        implementation-defined; POSIX.1-2008 specifies the behavior
        described in this man page.

sem_init.3
    mtk
        POSIX.1-2008 rectifies the POSIX.1-2001 omission, specifying
        that zero is returned by a successful sem_init() call.

core.5
    Mike Bianchi / mtk
        Make the page more helpful to non-programmers by referencing
        the documentation of the shell's 'ulimit' command in the
        discussion of RLIMIT_CORE and RLIMIT_FSIZE.
        SEE ALSO: Add bash(1).
    mtk
        Note that a core dump file can be used in a debugger.

proc.5
    mtk
        Remove /proc/PID/numa_maps material (it is now in numa(7)).

cpuset.7
    mtk
        SEE ALSO: Add numa(7).

inotify.7
    mtk / Li Zefan
         Explain bug that occurred in coalescing identical events in
         kernels before 2.6.25.
         (See commit 1c17d18e3775485bf1e0ce79575eb637a94494a2
         "A potential bug in inotify_user.c" in the 2.6.25 Changelog.)

pthreads.7
    mtk
        Update thread-safe functions list with changes in POSIX.1-2008.
        SEE ALSO: add proc(5).

signal.7
    mtk
        Update list of async-signal-safe functions for POSIX.1-2008.

---------------------------

fcntl.2
    mtk, after a note by Mike Bianchi
        More clearly and consistently describe whether
        or not the third argument to fcntl() is required,
        and what its type should be.
    mtk
        Move description of negative l_len  from NOTES, integrating
        it into the discussion of file locking.
        Minor rewrites of the text on file locking.

getrusage.2
    Bernd Eckenfels
        SEE ALSO: Add clock(3), clock_gettime(3).
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=353475

ioctl_list.2
    mtk
        Remove old sentence about where to send updates for this page.
        Add more detail on mount options that prevent updates to atime.

sched_setscheduler.2
    Carsten Emde
        Update kernel version numbers relating to real-time support.

stat.2
    H. Peter Anvin
        Note that lstat() will generally not trigger automounter
        action, whereas stat() will.

clock.3
    Bernd Eckenfels
        SEE ALSO: Add clock_gettime(3).
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=353475

clock_getres.3
    Tolga Dalman / mtk
        Add "Link with -lrt" to SYNOPSIS; remove now redundant
        sentence mentioning librt from NOTES.

getdate.3
    mtk
        Rewrite description of getdate_r() and integrate into main text
        (rather than describing in NOTES).
        Other parts rewritten for greater clarity.
        Make it clearer in the main text that glibc does not implement %Z;
        remove discussion of that point from NOTES.
        Added an example program.

hsearch.3
    mtk
        Noted that table size as specified by 'nel' is immutable.
        Described differences between hsearch() and hsearch_r().
        Added missing pieces to RETURN VALUE.
        Added a number of new entries under ERRORS.
        NOTES: added some basic advice on sizing the hash table;
        noted that when a table is destroyed, the caller is responsible
        for freeing the buffers pointed to by 'key' and 'data' fields.
        One of the BUGS was fixed in glibc 2.3.
        Rewrote and clarified various other pieces.
        Rename arguments for reentrant functions, using same name as
        glibc headers: s/ret/retval/; s/tab/htab/.
    mtk, after a suggestion by Timothy S. Nelson
        Integrate discussion of reentrant functions into main discussion
        (rather than as a short paragraph at the end).

iconv.3
    Bruno Haible
        Describe "shift sequence" input.

ptsname.3
    sukadev
        Fix return type of ptsname_r() in SYNOPSIS.

readdir.3
    H. Peter Anvin
        s/stat(2)/lstat(2)/ when discussing d_type (since we
        are talking about a case where we might be interested to
        whether the file itself is a symbolic link).

sigsetops.3
    Chris Head, signed-off-by: Mike Frysinger
        Fix typo: s/sigdelset/sigorset/

proc.5
    Mats Wichmann / mtk

    mtk / Mats Wichmann
        In the description if /proc/[pid]/environ, remove reference to
        lilo(8)/grub(8) since there seems to be nothing in those pages
        that related to this /proc file.
    Michael Schurter / mtk
        Remove sentence wrongly saying that /proc/meminfo reports
        info in bytes;
        see http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=462969
    mtk
        Note that /proc/meminfo reports system-wide memory usage
        statistics.
    Joe Korty
        Document new fields in /proc/interrupts that were added in
        Linux 2.6.24.

unix.7
    Marko Kreen
        Since glibc 2.8, _GNU_SOURCE must be defined in order to get
        the definition of the ucred structure from <sys/socket.h>.

--------------

closedir.3
dirfd.3
readdir.3
rewinddir.3
scandir.3
seekdir.3
telldir.3
    mtk
        Fix 'dir' argument name: should be 'dirp'.
        POSIX.1-2008 and glibc call this argument 'dirp' (consistent
        with the fact that it is a *pointer* to a DIR structure).

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

umount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Create a new page for umount() and umount2() by extracting
        existing material from mount.2 page.


New and changed links
---------------------

umount2.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change link to point to new umount.2
            The umount2() material migrated from mount.2 to umount.2


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

execve.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        _SC_ARG_MAX is no longer necessarily constant
            POSIX.1-2001 says that the values returned by sysconf()
            are constant for the life of the process.
            But the fact that, since Linux 2.6.23, ARG_MAX is settable
            via RLIMIT_STACK means _SC_ARG_MAX is no longer constant,
            since it can change at each execve().
    Michael Kerrisk
        Linux now imposes a floor on the ARG_MAX limit
            Starting with Linux 2.6.23, the ARG_MAX limit became
            settable via (1/4 of) RLIMIT_STACK.  This broke ABI
            compatibility if RLIMIT_STACK was set such that ARG_MAX
            was < 32 pages.  Document the fact that since 2.6.25
            Linux imposes a floor on ARG_MAX, so that the old limit
            of 32 pages is guaranteed.

            For some background on the changes to ARG_MAX in
            kernels 2.6.23 and 2.6.25, see:
                http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5786
                http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10095
                http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/646709/focus=648101,
                checked into 2.6.25 as
                commit a64e715fc74b1a7dcc5944f848acc38b2c4d4ee2.

            Also some reordering/rewording of the discussion of ARG_MAX.

fallocate.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note lack of glibc wrapper; caller must use syscall(2)
            Glibc doesn't (and quite probably won't) include a
            wrapper for this system call.  Therefore, point out that
            potential callers will need to use syscall(2), and rewrite
            the RETURN VALUE text to show things as they would be if
            syscall() is used.

    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer reader to posix_fallocate(3) for portable interface
            Add a para to start of page that points out that this is the
            low-level, Linux-specific API, and point the reader to
            posix_fallocate(3) for the portable API.

getdents.2
readdir.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        d_type is currently only supported on ext[234]
            As at kernel 2.6.27, only ext[234] support d_type.
            On other file systems, d_type is always set to DT_UNKNOWN (0).

getdents.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add an example program
    Michael Kerrisk
        comment out linux_dirent fields with varying location
            The location of the fields after d_name varies according to
            the size of d_name.  We can't properly declare them in C;
            therefore, put those fields inside a comment.
    Michael Kerrisk
        The DT_* constants are defined in <dirent.h>
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove header files from SYNOPSIS
            None of the header files provides what is needed.
            Calls are made via syscall(2).
    Michael Kerrisk
        The programmer must define the linux_dirent structure
            Point out that this structure is not defined in glibc headers.
    Michael Kerrisk
        s/dirent/linux_dirent/
            The structure isn't currently defined in glibc headers,
            and the kernel name of the structure is 'linux_dirent' (as
            was already used in some, but not all, places in this page).

getrlimit.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reword/relocate discussion of BSD's historical RLIMIT_OFILE
            The old sentence sat on its own in an odd place, and anyway the
            modern BSDs use the name RLIMIT_NOFILE.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer to execve(2) for RLIMIT_STACK's effect on ARG_MAX
            Refer the reader to new text in execve(2) that describes how
            (since Linux 2.6.23) RLIMIT_STACK determines the value of ARG_MAX.

getrusage.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rusage measures are preserved across execve(2)

mlock.2
    Maxin John
        Add EAGAIN error.

move_pages.2
    Nicolas François
        Make a detail of EPERM error more precise

mount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add description of per-process namespaces
            Describe per-process namespaces, including discussion
            of clone() and unshare CLONE_NEWNS, and /proc/PID/mounts.
    Michael Kerrisk
        List a few other file systems that we may see in /proc/filesystems
            Add some modern file systems to that list (xfs, jfs, ext3,
            reiserfs).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document MS_SILENT (and MS_VERBOSE)

mount.2
umount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Split umount*() out into a separate page
            The length of this page means that it's becoming difficult
            to parse which info is specific to mount() versus
            umount()/umount2(), so split the umount material out into
            its own page.

pause.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove mention of words "library function"
            This really is a system call.

readdir.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        The programmer must declare the old_linux_dirent structure
            Glibc does not provide a definition of this structure.
    Michael Kerrisk
        s/dirent/old_linux_dirent/
            Nowadays, this is the name of the structure in the
            kernel sources.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove words "which may change"
            These words are slightly bogus: although the interface
            is obsolete, for ABI-compatibility reasons, the kernel folk
            should never be changing this interface.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove header files from SYNOPSIS
            glibc doesn't provide any support for readdir(2),
            so remove these header files (which otherwise suggest
            that glibc does provide the required pieces).

recv.2
    Nicolas François
        Move kernel version number to first mention to MSG_ERRQUEUE.

semop.2
    Kirill A. Shutemov
        Fix typo in example
            (The '&' before sop in the semop() call is unneeded.)

send.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make kernel version for MSG_CONFIRM more precise
            s/2.3+ only/Since Linux 2.3.15/

sigaction.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer reader to signal(7) for an overview of signals
        Explain semantics of signal disposition during fork() and execve()
        Refer to signal(7) for more details on signal mask.

sigaltstack.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain inheritance of alternate signal stack across fork(2)

sigwaitinfo.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Distinguish per-thread and process-wide signals
            A sentence clarifying that pending signal set is union of
            per-thread and process-wide pending signal sets.

    Michael Kerrisk
        These interfaces have per-thread semantics
            The page was previously fuzzy about whether these interfaces
            have process-wide or per-thread semantics.  (E.g., now the
            page states that the calling *thread* (not process) is suspended
            until the signal is delivered.)

sigpending.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain effect of fork() and execve() for pending signal set
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain how thread's pending signal set is defined
            The pending set is the union of per-thread pending signals
            and process-wide pending signals.

sigprocmask.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain effects of fork() and execve() for signal mask

splice.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that SPLICE_F_MOVE is a no-op since kernel 2.6.21

syscall.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add more detail about wrapper functions
            Add a few more details about work generally done by wrapper
            functions.  Note that syscall(2) performs the same steps.

tkill.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        EINVAL error can also occur for invalid TGID
            The EINVAL error on an invalid TGID for tgkill() was
            not documented; this change documents it.

utimensat.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        POSIX.1-2008 revision will likely affect FTMs for futimens()
            Make it clear that the POSIX.1 revision that is likely
            to affect the feature test macro requirements for futimens()
            is POSIX.1-2008.
    Nicolas François
        Make various wordings a little more precise.
            The times argument point to *an array of* structures, and the
            man-page should say that consistently.

wait4.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        wait3() is a library function layered on wait4().
            On Linux wait3() is a library function implemented on top
            of wait4().  (Knowing this is useful when using strace(2),
            for example.)

atan2.3
    Nicolas François
        Fix error in description of range or return value
            In recent changes to the man page, mtk accidentally changed
            the description of the return value range to -pi/2..pi/2;
            the correct range is -pi..pi.

cmsg.3
    Nicolas François
        Add parentheses after macro names.

ctime.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify mktime()'s use of tm_isdst
            Describe use of tm_isdst for input to mktime();
            explain how mktime() modifies this field.
            (This field is left unchanged in case of error.)

            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=500178
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify wording for ctime_r() and asctime_r() to indicate that
        the buffer must be at least 26 *bytes*.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Minor rewording of mktime() description.

floor.3
    Nicolas François
        floor.3: Fix error in description: s/smallest/largest/

hsearch.3
    André Goddard Rosa
        Call hdestroy() after using hash table created by hcreate(),
        for the sake of completeness

mq_getattr.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        mq_getattr() and mq_setattr() are layered on mq_getsetattr(2)
            mq_getattr() and mq_setattr() are library functions layered on
            top of the mq_getsetattr(2) system call.
            (This is useful info for users of strace(1).)

mq_receive.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        mq_send() is a library function layered on mq_timedreceive() syscall
             This info is useful for users of strace(1).

mq_send.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        mq_send() is a library function layered on mq_timedsend() syscall
             This info is useful for users of strace(1).

nextafter.3
    Nicolas François
        Make description more precise: s/next/largest/

readdir.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add getdents(2)
             Because readdir() is implemented on top of getdents(2).

realpath.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that returned pathname is NULL terminated
            Also clarify that null-byte is included in PATH_MAX limit.

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite and simplify description of /proc/mounts
            Most of the relevant discussion is now under /proc/PID/mounts;
            all that needs to be here is a mention of the pre-2.4.19
            system-wide namespace situation, and a reference to the
            discussion under /proc/PID/mounts.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add description of /proc/PID/mounts
            Largely cribbed from existing /proc/mounts discussion, which is
            about to be rewritten.

mq_overview.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add mq_notify() to list of lib. functions and syscalls in MQ API

signal.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Improve description in NAME section
        Add mention of sigaltstack(2).
        Describe syscalls that synchronously wait for a signal,
        Give overview of syscalls that block until a signal is caught
        Add overview of interfaces for sending signals.

    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe semantics w.r.t. fork() and execve()
            Include text describing semantics of fork() and execve() for
            signal dispositions, signal mask, and pending signal set.

            Move the shell session text that demonstrates the use of
            the example program so that it precedes the actual
            example program.  This makes the page consistent with the
            majority of other pages.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

epoll_create.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Say more about unused epoll_create() 'size' arg
            Supply a little more explanation about why the 'size' argument
            of epoll_create() is nowadays ignored.

eventfd.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty text relating to flags argument
            Remove sentence saying that glibc adds a flags argument
            to the syscall; that was only relevant for the older
            eventfd() system call.
getdents.2
    Christoph Hellwig
        Fix text relating to DT_UNKNOWN and 'd_type' support
            Some file systems provide partial support for 'dt_type',
            returning DT_UNKNOWN for cases they don't support.
            Update the discussion of 'd_type' and DT_UNKNOWN to
            support this.

getpeername.2, getsockname.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add ip(7) and unix(7)

getsockopt.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        EINVAL can also occur if 'optval' is invalid
            In some cases, EINVAL can occur if 'optval' is invalid.
            Note this, and point reader to an example in ip(7).
            In response to:
            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=216092

inotify_init.2
pipe.2
timerfd_create.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify *_NONBLOCK description
            Make it clear that the NONBLOCK flag sets an attribute in the new
            open file description.

sched_yield.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite description in terms of threads
            The text formerly described the operation of sched_yield() in
            terms of processes.  It should be in terms of threads.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add NOTES text on appropriate use of sched_yield()
            Strategic calls to sched_yield() can be used to improve
            performance, but unnecessary use should be avoided.

sigaction.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that sa_mask affects the *per-thread* signal mask
            The page didn't previously clearly explain the scope of the
            signal mask that is affected by sa_mask.

signalfd.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty text relating to flags argument
            Remove sentence saying that glibc adds a flags argument
            to the syscall; that was only relevant for the older
            signalfd() system call.

sigprocmask.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that sigprocmask() operates on a per-thread mask
            The first sentence of the page was vague on the scope of the
            attribute changed by sigprocmask().  Reword to make this
            clearer and add a sentence in NOTES to explicitly state that
            the signal mask is a per-thread attribute.

socket.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document SOCK_NONBLOCK and SOCK_CLOEXEC flags
            These flags, specified in the 'type' argument, are supported
            since Linux 2.6.27.

socketpair.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer to socket(2) for SOCK_CLOEXEC and SOCK_NONBLOCK
            Refer the reader to socket(2) for a description of the SOCK_CLOEXEC
            and SOCK_NONBLOCK flags, which are supported by socketpair() since
            Linux 2.6.27.

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add new 2.6.27 system calls
            Add pipe2(), dup3(), epoll_create1(), inotify_init1(),
            eventfd2(), signalfd4().

timerfd_create.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document timerfd_create() TFD_CLOEXEC and TFD_NONBLOCK
            TFD_CLOEXEC and TFD_NONBLOCK are supported since LInux 2.6.27.

vfork.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify meaning of "child releases the parent's memory"
            The man page was not explicit about how the memory used by
            the child is released back to the parent.

ctime.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        ctime_r() and localtime_r() need not set 'timezone' and 'daylight'
            The man page already noted that these functions need not set
            'tzname', but things could be clearer: it tzset() is not called,
            then the other two variables also are not set.

            Also, clarify that ctime() does set 'timezone' and 'daylight'.

dlopen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        LD_LIBRARY_PATH is inspected once, at program start-up
            Make it clear that LD_LIBRARY_PATH is inspected *once*, at
            program start-up.  (Verified from source and by experiment.)

fmemopen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document binary mode (mode 'b')
            Glibc 2.9 adds support to fmemopen() for binary mode opens.
            Binary mode is specified by inclusion of the letter 'b' in
            the 'mode' argument.

getaddrinfo.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify error descriptions with some examples
            Clarify the description of some errors by giving examples
            that produce the errors.  (Text added for EAI_SERVICE and
            EAI_SOCKTYPE.)

            Also, add an error case for EAI_BADFLAGS.

gethostbyname.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rationalize text on POSIX.1-2001 obsolete interfaces
            POSIX.1 marks gethostbyname(), gethostbyaddr(), and 'h_errno'
            as obsolete.  The man page explained this, but with some
            duplication.  Remove the duplication, and otherwise tidy up
            discussion of this point.

popen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change one-line description in NAME
            s%process I/O%pipe stream to or from a process%
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document 'e' (close-on-exec) flag
            glibc 2.9 implements the 'e' flag in 'type', which sets the
            close-on-exec flag on the underlying file descriptor.

raise.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add pthread_kill(3)

readdir.3
    Christoph Hellwig
        Fix text relating to DT_UNKNOWN and 'd_type' support
            (This mirrors the previous change to getdents.2)
            Some file systems provide partial support for 'dt_type',
            returning DT_UNKNOWN for cases they don't support.
            Update the discussion of 'd_type' and DT_UNKNOWN to
            support this.

strcpy.3
    Jason Spiro
        Strengthen warning about checking against buffer overruns
            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=413940

tty_ioctl.4
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain capability requirements for TIOCCONS
            Explain capability requirements for TIOCCONS, and describe
            changes in 2.6.10 relating to capabilities.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain capability requirements for various ioctls
            For TIOCSLCKTRMIOS, TIOCSCTTY, TIOCEXCL, explain the exact
            capability that is required (the text formerly just said "root"
            in each case).

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max
            Defines the system-wide limit on the number of threads (tasks).

utmp.5
    Pierre Cazenave
        It is just "other" who should not have write perms on utmp
            The page was vague before, saying that utmp should not be
            writable by any user.  This isn't true: it can be, and
            typically is, writable by user and group.

epoll.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention epoll_create1() as part of epoll API
            epoll_create1() was added in Linux 2.6.27, and extends the
            functionality of epoll_create().

inotify.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention inotify_init1() in overview of API
            Discuss the new inotify_init1() system call in the overview of
            the inotify API.

ip.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Detail EINVAL error for IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP socket option
            In response to:
            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=216092

iso_8859-7.7
    Lefteris Dimitroulakis
        Add Drachma, Euro, and Greek Ypogegrammeni
            Also, amend description of characters 0241 and 0242.

man-pages.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Example shell sessions should have user input boldfaced

pthreads.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe return value from pthreads functions
            Describe the usual success (0) and failure (non-zero) returns,
            and note that POSIX.1-2001 specifies that pthreads functions
            can never fail with the error EINTR.

signal.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Timeouts make socket interfaces non-restartable
            If setsockopt() is used to set a timeout on a socket(),
            then the various socket interfaces are not automatically
            restarted, even if SA_RESTART is specified when
            establishing the signal handler.  Analogous behavior occurs
            for the "stop signals" case.

socket.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add unix(7)

ld.so.8
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document LD_USE_LOAD_BIAS
            Drawing heavily on Jakub Jelinek's description in
            http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-hacker/2003-11/msg00127.html
            (Subject: [PATCH] Support LD_USE_LOAD_BIAS)
        --inhibit-rpath is ignored for setuid/setgid ld.so
            The --inhibit-rpath option is ignored if ld.so is setuid/setgid
            (not if the executable is setuid/setgid).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since glibc 2.4, setuid/setgid programs ignore LD_ORIGIN_PATH
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix description of LD_PROFILE and LD_PROFILE_OUTPUT
            Clarify that LD_PROFILE is pathname or a soname,
            and identify name of profiling output file.
            Fix description of LD_PROFILE_OUTPUT, which wasn't even close to
            the truth.  (But why did it remain unfixed for so many years?)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since glibc 2.3.4, setuid/setgid programs ignore LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since version 2.3.5, setuid/setgid programs ignore LD_SHOW_AUXV
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reorder lists of LD_* environment variables alphabetically
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since glibc 2.3.4, setuid/setgid programs ignore LD_DEBUG

Global changes
--------------

pthread_attr_setaffinity_np.3
pthread_getattr_np.3
pthread_setaffinity_np.3
pthread_tryjoin_np.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain _np suffix
            Add text to CONFORMING TO explaining that the "_np"
            suffix is because these functions are non-portable.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

sched_setaffinity.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add sched_getcpu(3)

sched_setaffinity.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: Add pthread_setaffinity_np(3)

sched_setaffinity.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify EINVAL error for cpusetsize < kernel mask size
            For sched_setaffinity(), the EINVAL error that occurs
            if 'cpusetsize' is smaller than the kernel CPU set size only
            occurs with kernels before 2.6.9.

vfork.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Child holds parent's memory until execve() or *termination*
            The page was phrased in a few places to describe the child as
            holding the parent's memory until the child does an execve(2)
            or an _exit(2).  The latter case should really be the more
            general process termination (i.e., either _exit(2) or abnormal
            termination).

clock_getres.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID and CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID not settable
            According to POSIX.1-2001, the CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID and
            CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID clocks should be settable, but
            currently they are not.

pthread_attr_setstacksize.3
    Michael Kerrisk, after a report by Karsten Weiss
        EINVAL occurs on some systems if stacksize != page-size
            On MacOS X at least, pthread_attr_setstacksize(3) can fail
            with EINVAL if 'stacksize' is not a multiple of the system
            page size.  Best to mention this so as to aid people writing
            portable programs.

pthread_create.3
    Karsten Weiss
        Fix bug in EXAMPLE program
            The calloc() line should read like this instead:

                tinfo = calloc(num_threads, sizeof(struct thread_info));

pthread_exit.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        BUGS: thread group with a dead leader and stop signals
            Document the bug that can occur when a stop signal
            is sent to a thread group whose leader has terminated.
            http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/611611
            http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=122525468300823&w=2

resolver.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix prototype of dn_expand()
            The 4th argument is "char *", not "unsigned char *".
            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=504708

epoll.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix error handling after accept() in example code
            Simply continuing after an error is in most cases wrong,
            and can lead to infinite loops (e.g., for EMFILE).
            So handle an error by terminating.
            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=504202

epoll.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add error handling for epoll_wait() call in example code

epoll.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Improve example code
            Fill in some gaps in example code (variable declarations,
            adding listening socket to epoll set).
            Give variables more meaningful names.
            Other minor changes.
            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=504202

iso_8859-7.7
    Lefteris Dimitroulakis
        Add characters for Drachma and Greek Ypogegrammeni
            Lines for these two characters were added in the previous patch,
            but the actual characters were not included in the 4th column
            of the table.  This fixes that.

pthreads.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add a section describing thread IDs
            In particular, note that in each pthreads function that takes
            a thread ID argument, that ID by definition refers to a thread
            in the same process as the caller.

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

CPU_SET.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        New page documenting CPU_* macros
            This page contains material moved out of sched_setscheduler(2).
            It overwrites a previously existing link file with the same name.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add description of macros for dynamically allocated CPU sets
            Add descriptions of CPU_ALLOC(), CPU_ALLOC_SIZE(), CPU_FREE(),
            CPU_SET_S(), CPU_CLR_S(), CPU_ISSET_S(), CPU_ZERO_S(),
            CPU_COUNT_S(), CPU_AND_S(), CPU_OR_S(), CPU_XOR_S(), and
            CPU_EQUAL_S().
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add documentation of CPU_COUNT()
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add description of CPU_AND(), CPU_OR, CPU_XOR(), and CPU_EQUAL()
            Plus a few other small clean-ups of the text
    Michael Kerrisk
        Various improvements in DESCRIPTION
            After review comments by Bert Wesarg:
            * Explain that cpu_set_t is a bitset, but should be considered
              opaque.
            * A CPU set can be duplicated with memset().
            * Size of a CPU set is rounded up to size of long.
            * CPU_SETSIZE is in bits, but the setsize argument is in bytes.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document CPU_ALLOC()/CPU_ALLOC_SIZE() bug
            These macros return twice what they should because of thinko
            in glibc 2.8 and earlier.  The bug is fixed for glibc 2.9.
            http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=7029
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: Discuss use of types in "prototypes" for these macros
            The SYNOPSIS shows types for arguments and return values, but
            these are really just suggestions: since the interfaces are
            macros, the compiler won't catch all violations of
            the "type rules".  Warn the reader of this.

pthread_attr_setinheritsched.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        New page for pthread_attr_setinheritsched(3) and

Global changes
--------------

clone.2
mount.2
unshare.2
proc.5
path_resolution.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: s/namespace/mount-point namespace/, as appropriate
            In recent times, a number of other namespace flags have been
            added to clone(2).  As such, it is no longer clear to use
            the generic term "namespace" to refer to the particular
            namespace controlled by CLONE_NEWNS; instead, use the
            term "mount-point namespace".
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: s/mount-point namespace/mount namespace/
            This is more consistent with the term "mounts namespace"
            used in the 2008 ACM SIGOPS paper, "Virtual servers
            and checkpoint/restart in mainstream Linux".
            (I avoided the "s", because using the plural strikes me
            as klunky English, and anyway we don't talk about
            the "PIDs namespace" or the "networks namespace", etc..)

connect.2
listen.2
send.2
uname.2
cmsg.3
proc.5
arp.7
ddp.7
icmp.7
ip.7
raw.7
socket.7
tcp.7
udp.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: eliminate mention of the obsolete sysctl(2) interface
            Many pages still mention use of the obsolete sysctl(2) system
            call, or used the term "sysctls"; rewrite these mentions to
            instead be in terms of /proc interfaces.

mbsnrtowcs.3
mbsrtowcs.3

        Global fix: s/multi-thread/multithread/

getdents.2
pthread_attr_init.3
pthread_create.3
pthread_getattr_np.3
pthread_setaffinity_np.3
pthread_setschedparam.3
pthread_tryjoin_np.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Use consistent error-handling function names
            Many older pages use a handle_error() macro to do simple
            error handling from system and library function calls.
            Switch these pages to do similar.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

time.1

        Note that some shells have a 'time' built-in command
            Therefore, to access the functionality described on this page,
            it may be necessary to specify the full pathname.

clone.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Place list of CLONE_* flags in alphabetical order
            (No content changes.)
fsync.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update feature test macro requirements for fsync()
            Since glibc 2.8, the fsync() declaration is also exposed if
            _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L

sched_setaffinity.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add note on system-imposed restrictions on CPUs actually used
            After Loïc Domaigne's suggestion for pthread_setaffinity_np(3), add
            similar text to this page noting that the system silently
            limits the set of CPUs on which the process actually runs to
            the set of CPUs physically present and the limits imposed by
            cpuset(7).

sched_setaffinity.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Removed discussion of CPU_* macros()
            These macros are now moving to a separate page.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer reader to pthread_setaffinity_np(3)
            pthread_setaffinity_np() is preferable for setting
            thread CPU affinity if using the POSIX threads API.

sysctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add prominent warning against using this system call
            This was already stated under NOTES, but make it even more
            prominent by adding a sentence at the start of the DESCRIPTION.

uname.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add C comments describing fields in utsname structure

atan2.3
    Stefano Teso
        Fix description of range of function value return
            The range is not [-pi/2, pi/2], but [-pi, pi].

            (mtk: This error was reported by Nicolas François, and
            should have been fixed in 3.11, but somewhere along the way,
            the fix got lost.)

            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=506299

bindresvport.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since glibc 2.8, EPFNOSUPPORT error is now EAFNOSUPPORT
            Glibc switched to using a POSIX-specified error code for
            this error case.

            http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2375

clock_getres.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID and CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID not settable
            According to POSIX.1-2001, the CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID and
            CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID clocks should be settable, but
            currently they are not.

getgrnam.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify and add more detail in RETURN VALUE description
            The page was a bit fuzzy in describing the return values for
            various cases.  In particular, it needed to be more explicit
            in describing what happens for the "not found" case.

            This is an analogous change to the change for
            getpwnam.3, made after Andreas Henriksson's report.
            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=504787
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rename arguments to getgrnam_r() and getgrgid_r()
            s/gbuf/grp/ and s/gbufp/result/, for consistency
            with POSIX.1 argument names.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify RETURN VALUE description
            The page was a bit fuzzy in describing the return values for
            various cases.  In particular, it needed to be more explicit
            in describing what happens for the "not found" case.

            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=504708

getpwnam.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rename arguments to getpwnam_r() and getpwuid_r()
            s/pwbuf/pwd/ and s/pwbufp/result/, for consistency
            with POSIX.1 argument names.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify and add more detail in RETURN VALUE description
            The page was a bit fuzzy in describing the return values for
            various cases.  In particular, it needed to be more explicit
            in describing what happens for the "not found" case.

            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=504787
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add an EXAMPLE program for getpwnam_r()

inet_ntop.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rename 'cnt' argument to 'size'
            This is consistent with POSIX.1, and also a more sensible name.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework text describing 'size' argument
            (After a suggestion by Vegard Nossum.)
            Also made a few other small rewordings to in the initial
            paragraph.

makecontext.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add text on use of pointer arguments to makecontext()
            Passing pointer arguments to makecontext() is possible,
            but only on some architectures, and with no guarantees
            of portability.

            Reviewed-by: Loïc Domaigne

pthread_attr_setaffinity_np.3
pthread_setaffinity_np.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update to reflect new location of CPU_*() documentation
            The CPU_*() macros are now documented in CPU_SET.3;
            update to reflect that fact.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove redundant text relating to CPU sets
            Information about CPU_SETSIZE can be found in CPU_SET.3, so
            remove discussion of it here.

pthread_attr_setschedparam.3
pthread_setschedparam.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove text saying that only sched_priority is required by POSIX.1
            Loïc Domaigne points out that if a system implements
            SCHED_SPORADIC (which Linux does not), then other
            fields are also specified in sched_param.  The simple
            solution is just to remove that phrase from the man
            page.

pthread_cancel.3
pthread_detach.3
pthread_join.3
pthread_setaffinity_np.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make text of ESRCH error consistent

pthread_setaffinity_np.3

    Michael Kerrisk
        Various improvements after review by Loïc Domaigne
            Various fix-ups after Loïc's review.

            Reviewed-by: Loïc Domaigne

pthread_setschedparam.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED is default for inherit scheduler attribute
            In EXAMPLE, note that PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED is the default for
            the inherit scheduler attribute.

syslog.3
    Masanari Iida
        LOG_KERN messages can't be generated from user processes
            Masanari notes that this is an FAQ for logger(1) and that
            Solaris and FreeBSD document this point in syslog(3).
            The glibc info page also hides this comment in its source:

                Internally, there is also LOG_KERN, but LOG_KERN == 0,
                which means if you try to use it here, just selects default.

proc.5
    Ivana Varekova
        Fix reference to kernel source file
            Use relative reference to Documentation/mtrr.txt.

arp.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add kernel version numbers for /proc interfaces

cpuset.7

epoll.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note glibc version that added epoll support

icmp.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add kernel version numbers to /proc file descriptions

inotify.7
    Vegard Nossum
        Fix description of max_user_watches
            It seems that inotify(7) is wrong here:

            "/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches
                This specifies a limit on the number of watches that can be
                associated with each inotify instance."

            On my system, the default value for this variable is 8192. But I
            cannot create more than 8192 watches in total for the same UID
            even when they are on different inotify instances. So I suggest
            to rephrase this as: "This specifies an upper limit on the
            number of watches that can be created per real user ID."

ip.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reorder socket options alphabetically
    Michael Kerrisk
        Added kernel version numbers for IP_* socket options

            Looks like glibc has had this definition since about version 2.1.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Relocate kernel version information for ip_mreqn structure
    Michael Kerrisk
        Relocate info about Linux-specific sockopts to NOTES

        Fix incorrect variable names in example code
            s/snl/sa/ * 2

pthreads.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add section on cancellation points
            This section includes a list of the functions that must and
            may be cancellation points.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework, and fix small error in, thread-safe function list
            Integrate the changes that occurred in POSIX.1-2008 into the
            main list (to be consistent with the list, elsewhere on this
            page, of functions that are cancellation points).

            Also, fix an error that said that strerror() was added to
            the list in POSIX.1-2008.  It was strsignal() that was
            added.  (strerror() was already in the list in POSIX.1-2001.)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Tweak text on sigpause() cancellation point
            In POSIX.1-2008, this function moves from the "must be"
            to the "may be" list.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add ref to signal(7) for further info on use of real-time signals
            signal(7) provides some further details on the use of real-time
            signals by the two Linux threading implementations.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

_exit.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since glibc 2.3, the exit() wrapper function invokes exit_group(2)
            This information is useful to users of strace(1).

accept.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify details when returned address is truncated
            If the returned address is truncated, the 'addrlen' argument
            indicates the actual size of the address, rather than a count
            of the number of bytes in the truncated buffer.

            Also clarify that if 'addr' argument is NULL, then 'addrlen'
            should is unused, and should also be NULL.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reorder ERRORS list
            Some errors were listed under a separate "may" heading.
            There's probably no real need to do this; integrate
            those errors into the main list.

exit_group.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that since glibc 2.3, exit(2) invokes exit_group()

futex.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention that glibc provides no wrapper function for futex()

get_thread_area.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that glibc provides no wrapper for this system call

getdomainname.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Substantial rewrite
            Expand description of setdomainname() and getdomainname().
            Note that getdomainname() is implemented as a library function
            in glibc.
            Note limits on size of domain name.
            Reorganize ERRORS list.

gethostname.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Various parts rewritten
            Write a paragraph describing sethostname().

            Clarify differences between glibc's gethostbyname() and
            the kernel gethostbyname() system calls.

gethostname.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that HOST_NAME_MAX is 64 on Linux
            Also note that in pre-1.0 days, the limit on hostnames
            was 8 bytes.

getpeername.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that returned address may be truncated if buffer is too small

getsid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Simplified version information and moved to a new VERSIONS section

getsockname.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that returned address is truncated if buffer is too small

mknod.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer reader to makedev(3) to build a device ID

mmap.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Loosen language around how 'addr' hint is interpreted
            Mel Gorman reported that in Linux 2.6.27, 'addr' is rounded
            down to a page boundary.

            Before kernel 2.6.26, if 'addr' was taken as a hint, it was
            rounded up to the next page boundary.  Since Linux 2.6.24,
            it is rounded down.  Therefore, loosen the description of
            this point to say that the address is rounded to "a nearby
            page boundary".

open.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        EFBIG error is now EOVERFLOW (since Linux 2.6.24)
            When a 32-bit app opens a file whose size is too big to be
            represented in 31-bits, POSIX.1 specifies the error EOVERFLOW.
            Linux used to give EFBIG for this case, but 2.6.24 fixed this.

            Also, add some text to describe the error scenario in
            more detail.

pread.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that glibc emulation for these calls uses lseek(2)
            (This makes it clearer that the emulated calls are not atomic.)

recv.2
send.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make names of "address" and "address length" args more consistent
            Make the names of these arguments more consistent with other
            sockets man pages.

recv.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify details when returned address is truncated
            If the recvfrom() returned address is truncated, the 'fromlen'
            argument indicates the actual size of the address, rather than
            a count of the number of bytes in the truncated buffer.

            Also clarify that the 'from' argument can be NULL, in which
            case 'fromlen' should is unused, and should also be NULL.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Internet datagram and netlink sockets support MSG_TRUNC for recv(2)
            Internet datagram (since Linux 2.4.27/2.6.8),
            and netlink (since Linux 2.6.22) sockets support
            the MSG_TRUNC flag for recv(2).

select.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrote text describing feature test macros requirement for pselect()

select_tut.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix SHUT_FD* macros in example program
            Add "do {} while (0)"

set_thread_area.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that glibc provides no wrapper for this system call

setfsgid.2
setfsuid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Simplify version information and move to a VERSIONS section

setsid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework RETURN VALUE section; add an ERRORS section

setup.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Relocate some CONFORMING TO text to VERSIONS and NOTES

stat.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document EOVERFLOW error
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer reader to major() and minor() to decompose a device ID

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix version numbers for a few system calls
            Some 2.6 system calls were wrongly mentioned as also being
            backported into a 2.4.x kernel.

uname.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        DESCRIPTION: Point reader at NOTES for further info on field lengths

atan.3
    Andries E. Brouwer
        Fix return value description
            The correct range for the return value is [-pi/2,pi/2].
            (mtk's fix in the last change to the return value text was
            a botch-up of a (correct) suggestion by Nicolas François.)

atexit.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        atexit() and on_exit(3) register functions on the same list

        Terminating registered function using longjmp() is undefined
            According to POSIX.1, using longjmp() to terminate execution of
            a function registered using atexit() produces undefined results.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Calling exit(3) more than once produces undefined results
            If an exit handler itself calls exit(3), the results are
            undefined (see the POSIX.1-2001 specification of exit(3)).
    Michael Kerrisk
        The same exit handler may be registered multiple times
    Michael Kerrisk
        Calling _exit(2) terminates processing of exit handlers

bindresvport.3
    Mats Wichmann
        SYNOPSIS: s/\*\*/*/ in prototype
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix errors regarding port used, plus other rewrites
            Glibc's bindresvport() takes no notice of sin->sin_port:
            it always returns an arbitrary reserved port in the
            anonymous range (512-1023).  (Reported by Mats Wichmann.)

            Also:
            * Add EADDRINUSE and EACCES errors.
            * Mention use of getsockname(2).
            * Other minor rewrites and reorderings of the text.
            * Explicitly note that glib's bindresvport() ignores
              sin->sin_port.
            * Change license There's now virtually no text remaining from
              the 1.70 version of this page.

    Michael Kerrisk
        Arg given to registered function is status from *last* call to exit()
            It's a subtle point, but if a registered function itself
            calls exit(3), then subsequent functions that were registered
            with on_exit(3) will see the exit status given to the more
            recent exit(3) call.

            Clean up the $LANGUAGE description, by removing bogus comments

            Maybe you will decide that a more detailed description
            should be left to the gettext(3) documentation, but I
            actually care about the invisible part of the patch more
            since the comments have put me off the track initially
            ($LANGUAGE has nothing to do with setlocale(3) and is
             completely isolated to gettext, as obvious from the
             glibc sources).

        Various minor fixes as per Debian bug 471029
            The relevant pieces of
            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=471029 are:

              - Delete duplicate subentry for KEYCTL_CHOWN/KEYCTL_SETPERM
                operations in the CAP_SYS_ADMIN entry.  (It feels like that
                capability entry should be converted to a list, but I've
                left it in semicolon-delimited form for now.)

              - Remove text about ENFILE from the text about the
                /proc/sys/fs/file-max limit in the CAP_SYS_ADMIN entry, since
                this is already described in the man pages for the relevant
                ofile-creating system calls.

              - Correct or clarify a few other bits of grammar and such;
                see the diff file itself for details.

            this location is referred to just once on the page.

printf.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Source and destination buffers may not overlap for *s*printf()
            http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=7075

            Some existing code relies on techniques like the following to
            append text to a buffer:

                $ cat s.c
                #include <stdio.h>
                char buf[80] = "not ";
                main()
                {
                    sprintf(buf, "%sfail", buf);
                puts(buf);
                return 0;
                }

                $ cc s.c
                $ ./a.out
                not fail

            However, the standards say the results are undefined if source
            and destination buffers overlap, and with suitable compiler
            options, recent changes can cause unexpected results:

                $ cc -v 2>&1 | grep gcc
                gcc version 4.3.1 20080507 (prerelease) [gcc-4_3-branch revision 135036] (SUSE Linux)
                $ cc -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE -O2 s.c
                $ ./a.out
                fail

readdir.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite text describing 'dirent' fields standardized in POSIX.1
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify text for return value/errno setting for end-of-stream case

nscd.8
    Petr Baudis
        Correct NOTES section on reloading configuration files
            It behaved this way at least since
            "Sun Oct 18 15:02:11 1998 +0000",
            some four months after including the nscd implementation
            in glibc. But there does seem to be a short window between
            glibc-2.1 and glibc-2.1.3 when nscd -i was not available,
            I don't think it's worth muddling the point of the page
            with that, though.

            Some other minor rewordings also.

        SEE ALSO: Add getifaddrs(3)

signalfd.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix description of fork() semantics
            The page text described the semantics of the initial
            implementation of signalfd().  These were changed early on,
            but the man page wasn't updated.

byteorder.3

        SEE ALSO: add endian(3)

longjmp.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify wording re saving/restoring signal mask
    Michael Kerrisk
        siglongjmp() restores signal mask iff 'savesigs' was non-zero
            Note that siglongjmp() restores signal mask if, and only
            if, 'savesigs' argument of sigsetjmp() was non-zero.  (Previous
            text omitted the "and only if".)

memccpy.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix CONFORMING TO: s/C99/POSIX.1-2001/

setjmp.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify wording re saving/restoring signal mask
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify when setjmp() provides BSD vs System V signal mask semantics

strsep.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        BUGS: explicitly list problems afflicting strsep()
            Previously, the page said this function suffered the same
            problems as strtok(), but in fact strsep() doesn't suffer
            from all of the same problems as strtok(), so explicitly
            list just the problems of strsep() in the strsep.3 page.

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add pointer to epoll(7) for description of epoll /proc files

epoll.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Various wording changes to improve clarity and consistency

        Global fix: s/(3)/(2)/ in section number xrefs for timer_*() API
            The POSIX timers API is implemented (mostly) within the kernel,
            so these interfaces are system calls.  Although there are as yet
            no man pages, when they are added they should be in Section 2,
            not 3.  Therefore fix those pages that currently refer to these
            interfaces as being in Section 3.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

capget.2
    Andi Kleen
        Add some details and relocate a paragraph
            While writing a little program using capset
            I found the capset manpage quite light on crucial
            details and I had to resort to RTFS.

            This patch improves the points I found unclear
            and also moves one misplaced paragraph around.

clock_getres.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move page from Section 3 to Section 2

eventfd.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        glibc eventfd() supports the use of eventfd2() since version 2.9

fork.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add daemon(3)

getdents.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove unneeded HAVE_D_TYPE from example program
            Since d_type will always just return DT_UNKNOWN before
            kernel 2.6.4, we don't need to use a conditional for
            determining whether we use this flag.

nanosleep.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Relocated misplaced BUGS heading

select_tut.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clean up error checking in example program (no semantic changes)

        Many parts tidied and rewritten
            Remove some redundant text, clarify various pieces,
            tidy example code, etc.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Bug fixes + rewrites in example program
            Sebastien pointed out that the first example program
            wrongly thinks it can count signals.
            Also, some further rewrites by mtk.

socket.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        BUGS: Remove discussion SOCK_UUCP
            As time goes on, this sentence becomes less a piece of humor,
            and more a puzzle.

stat.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that open(O_NOATIME) also causes st_atime not to be updated

Global changes

Various pages
    Kir Kolyshkin
        Trivial punctuation fixes in SEE ALSO
            In SEE ALSO, when a few man pages are referenced, those
            are divided by commas.  Every reference is on a separate
            line, and all lines but the last one should end with
            comma. I spotted one place where there is no comma in
            between references, and mocked up an awk script to find
            similar places:

            for f in man*/*; do
                awk '
                    /^.SH ["]SEE ALSO["]/ {
                        sa=1; print "== " FILENAME " =="; print; next
                    }
                    /^\.(PP|SH)/ {
                        sa=0; no=0; next
                    }
                    /^\.BR/ {
                        if (sa==1) {
                            print;
                            if (no == 1)
                                print "Missing comma in " FILENAME " +" FNR-1; no=0
                        }
                    }
                    /^\.BR .*)$/ {
                        if (sa==1)
                            no=1;
                        next
                    }
                    /\.\\"/ {next}
                    /.*/ {
                        if (sa==1) {
                            print; next
                        }
                    }
                ' $f;
            done | fgrep 'Missing comma'

            This patch fixes all the places found by the above script.

            Also, there is an extra dot at the end of uri.7 "SEE ALSO"
            section.  Removed as per man-pages(7) recommendation.

splice.2
    Mark Hills
        ERRORS: Add EINVAL case for file opened O_APPEND
            Target file cannot be opened in append (O_APPEND) mode

            In kernels prior to v2.6.27 splice() to a file in
            append mode is broken, and since that version it is
            disallowed. It is possible this behaviour may change
            in the future; see the kernel commit message
            (efc968d450e013049a662d22727cf132618dcb2f) for more
            information.

timer_create.2
timer_delete.2
timer_getoverrun.2
timer_settime.2
numa.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make source layout of 'Link with' text consistent with other pages
            No actual change to formatted output, but this makes the
            page sources more consistent for the purpose of grepping, etc.

mempcpy.3
signbit.3
significand.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: acknowledge FSF in copyright
            These pages are heavily based on original material in
            glibc info pages, but the comments in the source of the pages
            did not acknowledge the FSF copyright on the original material.
            Fix that.

accept.2

send.2
write.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix discussion of EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK errors
            For a non-blocking socket, POSIX.1-2001/2008 allow either
            EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK to be returned in cases where a call
            would have blocked.  Although these constants are defined
            with the same value on most Linux architectures (PA-RISC
            is the exception), POSIX.1 does not require them to have
            the same value.  Therefore, a portable application using
            the sockets API should test for both errors when checking
            this case.

            (NB POSIX.1 only mentions EWOULDBLOCK in the context of
            the sockets interfaces.)

            Change made after a note cross-posted on linux-arch@vger,
            http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.debian.ports.hppa/5615
            and a suggestion for write(2) from Carlos O'Donell

        Add explicit character set encoding to first line of source
            Nowadays mandb has provision to understand a character set
            encoding that is explicitly indicated in the first line
            of the source.  As pointed out by Colin Watson, including
            such an explicit indication on pages encoded in anything
            other than ISO 8859-1 or UTF-8 is useful for man-pages
            that aren't shipped in UTF-8.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=519209
            and for some other background (responded to by Colin Watson

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

fallocate.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        VERSIONS: glibc support is provided since version 2.10

fcntl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove mention of EWOULDBLOCK from discussion of mandatory locking
            In the kernel, the error on encountering a mandatory lock is
            EAGAIN.  Although EAGAIN and EWOULDBLOCK are the same on
            most Linux architectures, on some they are not, so don't
            mention EWOULDBLOCK as it is misleading.  (Mea culpa.)

getcontext.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 removes the specification of getcontext()

getitimer.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 recommends POSIX timers API instead of this API

gettimeofday.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 recommends clock_gettime() instead of this API

ptrace.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note use of 'data' for PTRACE_SYS{CALL,EMU} and PTRACE_*_SINGLESTEP
            These operations use the 'data' argument as a signal number,
            like PTRACE_CONT.

ptrace.2
    Mike Frysinger
        only reference <sys/user.h>
            The kernel no longer installs linux/user.h, so update
            references to sys/user.h.

recv.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add 'iovec' defn to defn of 'msghdr' structure
            The 'msghdr' structure includes a field of type 'iovec',
            so show the definition of that structure in this page.

rename.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make ENOENT description consistent with POSIX.1-2008

timerfd_create.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: add EINVAL for invalid 'flags' for timer_settime()

truncate.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SYNOPSIS: Fix description of feature test macro requirements
            After a report by Arvid Norlander.

bcopy.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 removes specification of bcopy()

bsd_signal.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 recommends sigaction(2) instead of this API

ctime.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 recommends strftime(3) instead of these functions

ecvt.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 recommends sprintf(3) instead of these functions

gcvt.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 recommends sprintf(3) instead of this function

getcwd.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that getcwd() should be used instead of the obsolete getwd()

getgrent.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Returned buffer may be statically allocated and overwritten by
        later calls

gethostbyname.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        POSIX.1-2008 recommends getaddrinfo(3) and getnameinfo(3) instead

getnetent_r.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix function name in text: s/getnetbynumber_r/getnetbyaddr_r/
            The SYNOPSIS showed the right function name (getnetbyaddr_r),
            but the text repeatedly used the wrong name (getnetbynumber_r).
            Probably, this was a cut-and-paste error.

getpwent.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Returned buffer may be statically allocated and overwritten by
        later calls

index.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 recommends strchr(3) and strrchr(3) instead

isalpha.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain why POSIX.1-2008 marks isascii(3) obsolete

lockf.3
    Nikanth Karthikesan
        Update pointer to documentation in kernel source

makecontext.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 recommends the use of POSIX threads instead

mq_notify.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document the POSIX.1-2008 optional EINVAL error
            POSIX.1-2008 allows an optional EINVAL error if
            notification==NULL and the caller is not currently
            registered to receive notifications.

posix_fallocate.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that EINVAL also occurs of 'len' *equals* zero
            See http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12919

posix_fallocate.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008 specifications for EINVAL error
            See http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12919

        Document handling of size==0 case for posix_memalign()

pthread_exit.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix error in DESCRIPTION: s/pthread_create/pthread_exit/

realpath.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework resolved_path==NULL discussion w.r.t. POSIX.1-200[18]
            Although the page already mentioned the resolved_path==NULL
            feature, and that this feature was added in POSIX.1-2008, there
            was still some crufty text in BUGS that hadn't been updated to
            reflect the POSIX.1-2008 changes.

            Also, some other minor wording and grammar fixes.

scalb.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 recommends scalbln*(3) instead

seekdir.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SYNOPSIS: Fix type of 'offset' argument: s/off_t/long/
            And add a NOTES section pointing out that 'off_t'
            was indeed used in glibc 2.1.1 and earlier.
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=519230

sem_post.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document EOVERFLOW error

shm_open.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Recast discussion on name length to exclude terminating NULL byte
            Probably it's clearer to describe the length of the IPC object
            name as a count that excludes the null terminator.

siginterrupt.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 recommends sigaction() instead

sigset.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note APIs that POSIX.1-2008 recommends instead of these obsolete APIs

strftime.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Small fix to description of %G
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=516677

strftime.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add details on ISO 8601 week-based dates
            ISO 8602 week-based dates are relevant for %G, %g, and %V,
            and the existing details on these dates are a little thin.

strftime.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove mention of year from ISO 8601 standard
            The text mentioned the 1988 8601 standard, but there have
            already been two revisions of the standard since then, so
            simply remove mention of the year.

telldir.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SYNOPSIS: Fix return type: s/off_t/long/
            And add a NOTES section pointing out that 'off_t'
            was indeed used in glibc 2.1.1 and earlier.
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=519230

timeradd.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that on some systems, <=, >=, == don't work for timercmp()

timeradd.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SYNOPSIS: Fix return types of timerisset() and timercmp()

toascii.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note why POSIX.1-2008 marks this function obsolete

console_ioctl.4
    Alan Curry
        Fix 'argp' type for KDGETLED description
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=517485

resolv.conf.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that maximum value of 'timeout' option is capped to 30

hier.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add description of /srv
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=520904

ip.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix type used to declare sin6_port
            The page should use the type specified by POSIX,
            rather than the (equivalent) type used in the kernel

ipv6.7
    Teddy Hogeborn
        Fix types used to declare sin6_family and sin6_port
            The page should use the types specified by POSIX,
            rather than the (equivalent) types used in the kernel.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=517074

mq_overview.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Recast discussion on name length to exclude terminating NULL byte
            Probably it's clearer to describe the length of the IPC object
            name as a count that excludes the null terminator.

rtld-audit.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that multiple libraries in LD_AUDIT doesn't work
            This is reportedly fixed in glibc 2.10.
            See http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9733

sem_overview.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix discussion of length of semaphore names
            Because of the "sem." prefix added by glibc to a semaphore
            name, the limit on the length of the name (excluding the
            terminating null byte) is 251 characters.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

clone.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite crufty text about number of args in older version of clone()
                Some bit rot had crept in regarding the discussion of the
                number of arguments in older versions of this syscall.
                Simplify the text to just say that Linux 2.4 and earlier
                didn't have ptid, tls, and ctid arguments.

                See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=533868
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix version number for CLONE_NEWIPC
            It's 2.6.19, not 2.4.19.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix errors in argument names in text (ptid, ctd)

execve.2
    Mike Frysinger
        Remove erroneous statement that pending signal set is cleared
        on execve(2).

fcntl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        The kernel source file mandatory.txt is now mandatory-locking.txt
    Michael Kerrisk
        The Documentation/* files are now in Documentation/filesystems

flock.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove unneeded reference to Documentation/mandatory.txt
            Mandatory locks are only implemented by fcntl() locking
    Michael Kerrisk
        The Documentation/* files are now in Documentation/filesystems

fork.2
    Jeff Moyer
        Document fork() behaviour for the Linux native AIO io_context
            It was noted on lkml that the fork behaviour is documented
            for the POSIX AIO calls, but not for the Linux native calls.
            Here is a patch which adds a small blurb that folks will
            hopefully find useful.

            Upon fork(), the child process does not inherit the
            io_context_t data structures returned by io_setup,
            and thus cannot submit further asynchronous I/O or
            reap event completions for said contexts.

getdents.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        The d_type field is fully supported on Btrfs

mount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document MS_STRICTATIME, update description of MS_RELATIME
            Starting with Linux 2.6.30, the MS_RELATIME behavior became
            the default, and MS_STRICTATIME is required to obtain the
            traditional semantics.

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove EBADF error from ERRORS
            As reported by Motohiro:

            "man poll" describe this error code.

            >ERRORS
            > EBADF  An invalid file descriptor was given in one of the sets.

            but current kernel implementation ignore invalid file descriptor,
            not return EBADF.
            ...

            In the other hand, SUSv3 talk about

            > POLLNVAL
            >  The specified fd value is invalid. This flag is only valid in the
            >  revents member; it shall ignored in the events member.

            and

            > If the value of fd is less than 0, events shall be ignored, and
            > ireevents shall be set to 0 in that entry on return from poll().

            but, no desribe EBADF.
            (see http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/poll.html)

            So, I think the implementation is correct.

            Why don't we remove EBADF description?

sigaction.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Expand description of si_utime and si_stime fields of siginfo_t

stat.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Improve wording of ENOTDIR error

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add preadv() and pwritev(), new in kernel 2.6.30

wait.2
    Gokdeniz Karadag
        Document CLD_DUMPED and CLD_TRAPPED si_code values

daemon.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify discussion of 'noclose' and 'nochdir' arguments

ffs.3
    Petr Baudis
        SEE ALSO: add memchr(3)

fmemopen.3
    Petr Baudis
        Relocate BUGS section to correct position
    Petr Baudis
        NOTES: there is no file descriptor associated with the returned stream
            Alexander Lamaison pointed out that this is not obvious
            from the documentation, citing an example with passing the
            FILE * handle to a function that tries to fstat() its
            fileno() in order to determine the buffer size.
    Michael Kerrisk
        CONFORMING TO: remove note that these functions are GNU extensions
            That sentence is now redundant, since these functions
            are added in POSIX.1-2008.

lockf.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify relationship between fcntl() and lockf() locking

memchr.3
    Petr Baudis
        SEE ALSO: add ffs(3)

readdir.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        The d_type field is fully supported on Btrfs

setjmp.3
    Mike Frysinger
        Fix typo and clarify RETURN description
            The word "signal" was duplicated in NOTES, and the RETURN
            section refers to setjmp() and sigsetjmp(), and mentions
            longjmp(), but not siglongjmp().

strcmp.3
    Petr Baudis
        SEE ALSO: add strverscmp(3)

strcpy.3
    Mark Hills
        SEE ALSO: Add strdup(3)

complex.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add missing header file for example program
    Reimar Döffinger
        Fix type used in example code
        man complex (from release 3.18) contains the following code:
            complex z = cexp(I * pi);
        Reading the C99 standard, "complex" is not a valid type,
        and several compilers (Intel ICC, ARM RVCT) will refuse to compile.
        It should be
            double complex z = cexp(I * pi); instead.

environ.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that last element in environ array is NULL
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=528628
    Michael Kerrisk
        Wording fixes

mq_overview.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that mkdir and mount commands here need superuser privilege
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix example showing contents of /dev/mqueue file

standards.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove references to dated books
            Gallmeister and Lewine are rather old books. Probably,
            there are better books to consult nowadays, and anyway,
            this man page isn't intended to be a bibliography.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

execve.2
pipe.2
tee.2
fmemopen.3
mq_notify.3
qsort.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Replace use of assert() by code that checks argc
            See http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13569

            As noted by Andrey:
            The purpose of the assert macro, defined in <assert.h>,
            is to provide a tool to check for programming mistakes
            or program logic errors. However, the assert macro must
            never be used to perform checks for run time errors,
            since, with the NDEBUG macro defined, expressions within
            the assert macro invocations are not evaluated/checked
            for, resulting in behavior that was not originally intended.
            ...
            The pages affected in the core package are

            execve(2)
            pipe(2)
            tee(2)
            fmemopen(3)
            mq_notify(3)
            qsort(3)

getrusage.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ru_inblock and ru_oublock are now implemented
            These fields of the rusage structure are filled in since
            Linux 2.6.22.

mmap.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add brief documentation of MAP_HUGETLB
            This flag is new in 2.6.32, and serves a similar
            purpose to the shmget() SHM_HUGETLB flag.

open.2
    Christoph Hellwig
        add some comments on O_SYNC and friends

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify wording describing of 'nfds' argument.
            reported by: rui rlex <rui.rlex@gmail.com>

semctl.2
    Nicolas François
        Remove some redundant words

setpgid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add an explanation of orphaned process groups

splice.2
tee.2
vmsplice.2
    Mark Hills
        Fix return type
            Since glibc 2.7, the return type for these functions
            is ssize_t (formerly it was long).

stat.2
    Nicolas François
        Fix small bug in example program
            Since it is a failure, EXIT_FAILURE looks more appropriate
            than EXIT_SUCCESS.

umount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        glibc only exposes MNT_DETACH and MNT_EXPIRE since version 2.11
            See http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=10092

exit.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add a pointer to explanation of orphaned process groups in setpgid(2)

fflush.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        fflush() discards buffered input

ffs.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that ffsl() and ffsll() are GNU extensions

getaddrinfo.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note nonstandard assumed hints.ai_flags value when hints is NULL
            When hints is NULL, glibc assumes hints.ai_flags is
            AI_V4MAPPED|AI_ADDRCONFIG whereas POSIX says 0.
            According to Ulrich Drepper, glibc's behavior is better.

getmntent.3
    Mike Frysinger
        setmntent() argument is 'filename' not 'fp'
            The description of setmntent() formerly used the wrong
            argument name.

posix_fallocate.3
    Nicolas François
        Fix reference to POSIX.1-2008
            The sentence mentions twice POSIX.1-2001.
            I guess the second one should be POSIX.1-2008.
            This should be checked in the standard.

setenv.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Improve ERRORS section
            Add ENOMEM error; improve EINVAL description. Also, make
            RETURN VALUE section a little more accurate in its mention
            of errno.

strftime.3
    Nicolas François
        Fix error in description: s/Monday/Thursday/

proc.5
    Nicolas François
        Fix page cross reference
            max_user_watches is better explained in epoll(7) than inotify(7).

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        dmesg is in section 1, not section 8

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        FS UID manipulations affect CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE and CAP_MKNOD
            Nowadays, file system UID manipulations also affect
            CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE (since 2.6.3) and CAP_MKNOD (since 2.6.29).

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix version number for CAP_MKNOD in FS UID manipulations
            A recent patch said "since 2.6.29". It should have
            been "since 2.6.30".

capabilities.7
    Nicolas François
        Reword a bad sentence in description of capability bounding set.

mq_overview.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change documented ranges for msg_max and msgsize_max
            Linux 2.6.28 changed the permissible ranges for
            these /proc files.

              1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC)

            That form is more consistent, logical, precise, and internationally
            recognizable than the other variants.

            Also, some wording has been altered as well.

            or _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809 exposes the declarations of
            these functions.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

clock_getres.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update text on nonsetabble CLOCK_*_CPUTIME_ID clocks
            SUSv3 permits, but does not require CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID and
            CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID to be settable.
            See http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11972.

execve.2
    Colin Watson
        Fix description of treatment of caught signals
            Caught signals reset to their default on an execve() (not
            to being ignored).

fcntl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        s/F_OWNER_GID/F_OWNER_PGRP/
            Peter Zijlstra took the name change I suggested.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document F_[SG]ETOWN_EX; update details on F_SETOWN
            Linux 2.6.32 adds F_SETOWN_EX and F_GETOWN_EX.
            Linux 2.6.12 changed (broke) the former behavior of
            F_SETOWN with respect to threads.

intro.2
intro.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make subsection heading consistent with other intro.? pages
            These pages used "Copyright Terms"; the other intro.? pages
            used "Copyright Conditions". Make these pages like the others.

sendfile.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify behavior when 'offset' is NULL

seteuid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note unstandardized behavior for effective ID
            POSIX.1 doesn't require that the effective ID can be changed
            to the same value it currently has (a no-op). The man page
            should note this, since some other implementations
            don't permit it.

setgid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix EPERM error description
            s/effective group ID/real group ID/
            This bug lived in man pages for 15 years before Jason
            spotted it! I checked back in Linux 1.0, and the behavior
            was as the fixed man page describes.

setreuid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add more detail on POSIX.1 specification for these syscalls

setuid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty statement that seteuid() is not in POSIX
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=569812

stime.2
strftime.3
tzset.3
zic.8
    Michael Witten
        GMT -> UTC (where appropriate)

sync_file_range.2
    Christoph Hellwig
        Add some big warnings re data integrity
            This system call is by design completely unsuitable for any data
            integrity operations.  Make that very clear in the manpage.

CPU_SET.3
    Vlastimil Babka
        SYNOPSIS: Fix return types for CPU_COUNT_*()
            These functions return 'int' not void'.

confstr.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix feature test macro requirements

daemon.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix description of 'nochdir' argument.
            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=554819

gethostbyname.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document feature test macro requirements for herror() and hstrerror()
            Since glibc 2.8, one of _BSD_SOURCE, _SVID_SOURCE,
            or _GNU_SOURCE is required.

getline.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update to reflect that these functions were standardized in POSIX.1-2008

getnameinfo.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document feature test macros requirements for NI_MAXHOST and NI_MAXSERV
            Since glibc 2.8, one of _BSD_SOURCE, _SVID_SOURCE, or _GNU_SOURCE
            must be defined to obtain these definitions.

getopt.3
    Jonathan Nieder
        Fix feature test macro requirements

memchr.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add feature text macro requirements for memrchr()

nextafter.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix notable error in DESCRIPTION.
        "less than y" should be "less than x".

popen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix feature test macro requirements

pthread_attr_setdetachstate.3
pthread_attr_setschedparam.3
pthread_attr_setschedpolicy.3
    Denis Barbier
        Argument name is 'attr' not 'thread'
            The function argument was misnamed in the DESCRIPTION on these
            three pages.

rtnetlink.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Various fixes in example code
            Edward reported a problem in the example code, where a variable
            seems to be misnamed. Upon inspection, there seem to be a few
            such instances, and this patch is my best guess at how things
            should look.

sched_getcpu.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Place correct header file in SYNOPSIS

sleep.3
    Bill O. Gallmeister
        sleep() puts calling *thread* to sleep (not calling *process*)

sleep.3
    Bill O. Gallmeister
        Add nanosleep(2) to SEE ALSO

strftime.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        %z is defined in SUSv3
            So, substitute "GNU" tag in man page by "SU".

strftime.3
    Michael Witten
        Move 822-compliant date format example to EXAMPLES section
            The RFC 822-compliant date format given in the description
            of `%z' is now moved to the `EXAMPLES' section (note: `EXAMPLE'
            has been renamed `EXAMPLES').

            Furthermore, that format example is now actually
            RFC 822-compliant (using `%y' instead of `%Y') and has been
            qualified as being correct only when in the context of at least
            an English locale. Also, `%T' is used in place of `%H:%M:%S'.

            For completeness, an RFC 2822-compliant format example has been
            similarly added.

strftime.3
    Michael Witten
        Expand introductory text

strftime.3
    Michael Witten
        Clarification of %z specifier

string.3
    Mark Hills
        Add stpcpy() to this list of string functions

strptime.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Initialize tm structure in example program

undocumented.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove pages now documented
            By now, the following are documented:

                fopencookie(3)
                freeifaddrs(3)
                rawmemchr(3)
                readdir_r(3)
                getutmp(3)
                getutmpx(3)
                utmpxname(3)

            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=554819

group.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        s/passwd/password/
            The page inconsistently used "passwd" and "password"
            to refer to the same field.

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update securebits discussion to use SECBIT_* flags

feature_test_macros.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200808 defines _ATFILE_SOURCE
            Since glibc 2.10, _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200808 defines _ATFILE_SOURCE

path_resolution.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add readlink(2) to SEE ALSO
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix NAME line
            The poorly constructed part preceding "\-" causes apropos
            not to be able to find the subject.

            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=558300

signal.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix discussion of SIGUNUSED
            Clarify that this signal really is synonymous with SIGSYS.
            See http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14449

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

migrate_pages.2
    Andi Kleen
        New page documenting migrate_pages(2).
            Andi's text based on the move_pages.2 page;

            migrate_pages(2) was new in Linux 2.6.16.

quotactl.2
    Jan Kara
        Major updates
            Update the page to consolidate information from the
            outdated man-pages quotactl.2 page and the quotactl.2
            page in the "quota-tools" package. The page in "quota-tools"
            has now been dropped by Jan Kara, so that there is just one
            canonical quotactl.2 page (in pan-pages).

Global changes
--------------

open.2
sync_file_range.2
umount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: s/filesystem/file system/


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

fcntl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that glibc 2.11 papers over the kernel F_GETOWN bug
            Since version 2.11, glibc works around the kernel limitation for
            process groups IDs < 4096 by implementing F_GETOWN via F_GETOWN_EX.

futex.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Various fixes in SEE ALSO

getpriority.2
nice.2
    Francesco Cosoleto
        Move renice from section 8 to section 1

getrusage.2
    Mark Hills
        Add ru_maxrss
            See kernel commit 1f10206.
    Mark Hills
        Description of maintained fields
            These descriptions are taken from NetBSD 5.0's getrusage(2).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Enhanced description of various fields

mlock.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        /proc/PID/status VmLck shows how much memory a process has locked
            After a note from Tom Swigg, it seems sensible mention VmLck here.

mount.2
    Petr Uzel
        Fix incorrect path

move_pages.2
    Andi Kleen
        Clarify includes/libraries

mremap.2

    Francesco Cosoleto
        Move ipcs from section 8 to section 1

open.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove ambiguity in text on NFS and O_EXCL.

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix discussion of ppoll() timeout argument
            1. Rename ppoll)(_ argument to "timeout_ts" to distinguish it
               from the poll() argument in the text.
            2. More accurately describe the poll() call that is equivalent
               to ppoll().

posix_fadvise.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add sync_file_range(2) under SEE ALSO

prctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Correct PR_SET_KEEPCAPS description
            The "keep capabilities" flag only affects the treatment of
            permitted capabilities, not effective capabilities.
            Also: other improvements to make the PR_SET_KEEPCAPS text clearer.

select_tut.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix bug in example program

sigaction.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add TRAP_BRANCH and TRAP_HWBKPT to si_code values for SIGTRAP

    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some details for SIGTRAP and si_trapno
    Andi Kleen
        Document hwpoison signal extensions

statfs.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Bring statfs struct type declarations closer to glibc reality
    Fang Wenqi
        Add definition EXT4_SUPER_MAGIC = 0xEF53
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document f_frsize field.

statvfs.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move this page to section 3 (since it's a library call)

swapon.2
    Ivana Hutarova Varekova
        Note effect of CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE on MAX_SWAPFILES
            From 2.6.32, MAX_SWAPFILES is decreased by 1 if the kernel is
            built with CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE.

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Bring system call list up to date with Linux 2.6.33
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix kernel version number for utimes()

cproj.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note fix for C99 conformance in glibc 2.12.

crypt.3
    Petr Baudis
        Correct note on key portion significance
            As Marcel Moreaux notes:

                The Linux manpage for crypt()[1] contains the following
                statement as the last sentence of the NOTES section:

                    In the SHA implementation the entire key is significant
                    (instead of only the first 8 bytes in MD5).

                It should probably say "DES" where it says "MD5" (and maybe
                "MD5/SHA" where it says "SHA"), because in MD5 password hashing,
                the entire key is significant, not just the first 8 bytes.

            This patch fixes the wording.

fmemopen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Bug fix in example program

ftw.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that if 'fn' changes CWD, the results are undefined
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify description of fpath argument
            As reported by Pierre Habouzit, 'fpath' is not relative
            to 'dirpath'. It is either relative to the calling process's
            current working directory (if 'dirpath' was relative), or it
            is absolute (if 'dirpath' was absolute).

getaddrinfo.3
    Christian Franke
        Fix a field name mixup: s/ai_family/ai_flags/

getline.3
    Robert Wohlrab
        Remove unneeded check before free()
            The manpage of getline shows an example with an extra NULL pointer
            check before it calls free. This is unneeded according to free(3):

                 If ptr is NULL, no operation is performed.

            This patch removes the "if" check.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=572508

log.3
log10.3
log2.3
    Jan Engelhardt
        Add cross-references to other-base logarithmic functions

opendir.3
    Petr Baudis
        Specify feature test macro requirements for fdopendir(3)
            Currently, there is no note on the fact that fdopendir() is
            POSIX.2008-only.

openpty.3
    Eric Blake
        Use const as appropriate
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note glibc version that added "const" to function arguments
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explicitly note that these functions are not in POSIX

resolver.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix declaration of dn_comp() in SYNOPSIS
            Remove the second 'exp_dn' from the calling signature.

termios.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change NOFLSH text to speak of characters, not signals

core.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update description of coredump_filter
            Kernel 2.6.24 added MMF_DUMP_ELF_HEADERS.
            Kernel 2.6.28 added MMF_DUMP_HUGETLB_PRIVATE and
            MMF_DUMP_HUGETLB_SHARED.

elf.5
    Daisuke HATAYAMA
        Document PN_XNUM extension
            In linux-2.6.34-rc1, an ELF core extension was added; user-land
            tools manipulating ELF core dump such as gdb and binutils has
            already been modified before; so elf.5 needs to be modified
            accordingly.

            You can follow information on the ELF extension via the LKML post:
            http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/1/3/103
            Date        Mon, 04 Jan 2010 10:06:07 +0900 (JST)
            Subject     ... elf coredump: Add extended numbering support

            This Linux-specific extension was added in kernel 2.6.34.

        Remove EI_BRAND
            As reported by Yuri Kozlov  and confirmed by Mike Frysinger,
            EI_BRAND is not in GABI
            (http://www.sco.com/developers/gabi/latest/ch4.eheader.html)
            It looks to be a BSDism
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove words under '.note': "described below"
            The existing text is broken, because there is
            no '"Note Section" format' describe below. Simplest
            solution is to remove the words "described below".

filesystems.5
    Jeff Barry
        Add discussion of ntfs and ext4

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Simplify description of /proc/sys and /proc/sys/fs
            In the description of these directories, there's no need
            to list all the files and subdirectories that they contain;
            that information is provided by the entries that follow.

services.5
    Yuri Kozlov
        Remove crufty reference to nonexistent BUGS section

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document CAP_SYS_RESOURCE and F_SETPIPE_SZ

        Make a clearer statement about nonportable aspect of signal(2)
            Make a clearer statement that signal(2) is less portable for
            establishing a signal handler.

socket.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Use consistent language to describe read-only socket options

udp.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add FIONREAD warning.
            Warn that FIONREAD can't distinguish case of a zero-length

            This patch fixes the type of msg_controllen in the struct msghdr
            definition given in send.2 and recv.2 to match the definition in
            glibc and the kernel.

            Make it clear that modern glibc uses the kernel pselect()

            ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub.
            (It's an open question whether or not a version of tzfile.5
            should live independently in man-pages. It was added to the
            man-pages set many years ago. For now, I'll follow a
            conservative course that causes least pain to downstream,
            by continuing to maintain a separate copy in man-pages.)

        Add/fix/update feature test macro requirements in SYNOPSIS
            Various changes to:
            * Update feature test requirements to note changes in
              recent glibc releases
            * Correct errors in feature test macro requirements
            * Add feature test macro requirements to pages where
              the requirements were not previously stated.

            prototypes. Add a reference to feature_test_macros(7),
            so that readers are pointed to the information that
            feature test macros must be defined before including
            *any* header file.

            Programmers often make the mistake of including a feature test
            macro only after having already included some header files.
            This patch adds some text at opportune places to remind
            programmers to do things the right way.

            See http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11235

stat.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update information on nanosecond timestamp fields
            Update feature test macro requirements for exposing these fields.

            was (silently) resolved.

insque.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Noted prev == NULL bug in glibc 2.4 and earlier
            As noted by Remi Denis-Courmont, glibc nowadays allows
            'prev' to be NULL, as required by POSIX for initializing
            a linear list. But in glibc 2.4 and earlier, 'prev' could
            not be NULL. Add a BUGS section noting this.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=551201
    Michael Kerrisk
        Added info on circular lists, and initializing circular lists

New and rewritten pages

Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

posix_fadvise.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document the architecture-specific arm_fadvise64_64() system call
            This ARM-specific system call fixes the argument ordering
            for that architecture. Since Linux 2.6.14.

sync_file_range.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document the architecture-specific sync_file_range2() system call
            As described in commit edd5cd4a9424f22b0fa08bef5e299d41befd5622,
            the sync_file_range() argument order is broken for some
            architectures (PowerPC, ARM, tile). The remedy was a different
            system call using the right argument order on those architectures.

psignal.3
    Guillem Jover
        Document psiginfo()
            psiginfo() was added to glibc in version 2.10.

Global changes
--------------

Many pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        global fix: s/Unix/UNIX/
            The man pages were rather inconsistent in the use of "Unix"
            versus "UNIX". Let's go with the trademark usage.

Various pages

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

inotify_rm_watch.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SYNOPSIS: fix type of 'wd' argument

posix_fadvise.2

        Add the PowerPC-specific subpage_prot() system call
        Add sync_file_range2()

        SEE ALSO: Add lio_listio(3)

gai_cancel.3
gai_error.3
gai_suspend.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make these into links
            In the previous release, these files were accidentally made copies
            of getaddrinfo_a.3, instead of being made as link files.

getifaddrs.3
    Thomas Jarosch
        Prevent possible NULL pointer access in example program

malloc.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Emphasize that malloc() and realloc() do not initialize allocated memory

malloc_hook.3
    Ivana Varekova
        Warn that these functions are deprecated

strcpy.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Formatting fixes in strncpy() example implementation code

    Michael Kerrisk
        Reword NOTES on Linux-specific options

sigevent.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: Add aio_read(3), aio_write(3), and lio_listio(3)

unix.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document the autobind feature
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix description of abstract socket names
            As reported by Lennart Poettering:
                The part about "abstract" sockets is misleading as it suggests
                that the sockaddr returned by getsockname() would necessarily
                have the size of sizeof(struct sockaddr), which however is not
                the case: getsockname() returns exactly the sockaddr size that
                was passed in on bind(). In particular, two sockets that are
                bound to the same sockaddr but different sizes are completely
                independent.
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19812
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix description of "pathname" sockets
            As reported by Lennart Poettering:
               The part about "pathname" sockets suggests usage of
               sizeof(sa_family_t) + strlen(sun_path) + 1
               for calculating the sockaddr size. Due to alignment/padding
               this is probably not a good idea. Instead, one should use
               offsetof(struct sockaddr_un, sun_path) + strlen() + 1
               or something like that.
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19812

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

kexec_load.2
    Andi Kleen
        New page documenting kexec_load(2)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add license
    Michael Kerrisk
        Incorporate fixes from Eric W. Biederman
            Eric noted that a few instances of "virtual" should
            be "physical" and noted:

                There is an expectation that at hand off from sys_kexec that
                virtual and physical addresses will be identity mapped. But
                this isn't the old Alpha booting convention where you have
                a virtual address and then you have to parse the page table
                to figure out where your kernel was actually loaded.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Additions and edits by mtk
            Various wording and layout improvements.
            Fixed the name of a constant: s/KEXEC_ARCH_I386/KEXEC_ARCH_386/.
            Added RETURN VALUE and ERRORS sections.
            Added VERSIONS section
            Note that CONFIG_KEXEC is needed
            Removed details of using syscall; the reader can find them in
            syscall(2).
            Added some details for KEXEC_PRESERVE_CONTEXT.
            Revised the text mentioning the kernel header, since it is
            not yet exported, and it's not certain that it will be.

lio_listio.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        New page documenting lio_listio(3)


Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

reboot.2

    Lucian Adrian Grijincu
        Improve description of CLONE_NEWNET
            CLONE_NEWNET creates a new network namespace from scratch.
            You don't have anything from the old network namespace in
            the new one. Even the loopback device is new.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document CLONE_SYSVSEM
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document CLONE_NEWUTS
    Michael Kerrisk
        Relocate discussion of CAP_SYS_ADMIN to CLONE_NEWNS section
            And rewrite the EPERM description to be more general in
            preparation for the new flags to be documented.


Global changes
--------------

Various pages

koi8-r.7
    David Prevot
        Fix special character names
            Comparing to koi8-u.7, I noticed some inconsistencies in special
            character names. After checking with the following Unicode related
            pages, please find inline (and gzipped attached, hopefully not
            messing with encoding), a patch in order to make it right, on an
            Unicode point of view.

            http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2500.pdf
            http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U25A0.pdf
            http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0080.pdf
            http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1D400.pdf
    David Prevot
        Fix SEE ALSO reference and letter names
            The koi8-r(7) (Russian Net Character Set) manual page refers
            to iso-8859-7(7) manual page, which is the Latin/Greek one.
            I guess it should refer instead to the iso-8859-5(7)
            (Latin/Cyrillic) one. This is addressed at the end of the patch.

            It has also been spotted that letter names are different in
            this manual page and in the Unicode related page [0], the
            first part of the page address this.

                    0: http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0400.pdf

man-pages.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update example
            The old example used the chmod(2) man page, but the
            feature test macro requirements on that page had changed.
            Update to use an example from a different page (acct(2),
            whose feature test macro requirements are probably unlikely
            to change in the future).

            overlap.)

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=603144

unix.7
    Michael Kerrisk

        Clean up description of error message source
            In the second paragraph of DESCRIPTION section, one of the
            sources of error messages is incorrect: the four functions obtain
            error message only from errno, and "a code" is just relevant

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

sendmmsg.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Stephan Mueller]
        New page for sendmmsg(2)
            Some pieces inspired by an initial attempt by Stephan Mueller.


Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

fallocate.2
    Lucian Adrian Grijincu
        Document FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE
            FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE was added in Linux 2.6.38,
            for punching holes in the allocated space in a file.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

dup.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SYNOPSIS: Add "#include <fcntl.h>" for O_* constants

fallocate.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Substantial restructuring of DESCRIPTION
            The addition of a second class of operation ("hole punching")
            to the man page made it clear that some significant restructuring
            is required. So I substantially reworked the page, including the
            preexisting material on the default "file allocation" operation.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Josef Bacik]
        Add further details for FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: Add EPERM error case for FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE

fork.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: Describe clone() call equivalent to fork()

fsync.2
    Christoph Hellwig
        Various improvements
            - explain the situation with disk caches better
            - remove the duplicate fdatasync() explanation in the NOTES
              section
            - remove an incorrect note about fsync() generally requiring two
              writes
            - remove an obsolete ext2 example note
            - fsync() works on any file descriptor (doesn't need to be
              writable); correct the EBADF error code explanation
    Michael Kerrisk  [Guillem Jover]
        Note that some systems require a writable file descriptor
            An edited version of Guillem Jover's comments:
            [While the file descriptor does not need to be writable on Linux]
            that's not a safe portable assumption to make on POSIX in general
            as that behavior is not specified and as such is
            implementation-specific. Some Unix systems do actually fail on
            read-only file descriptors, for example [HP-UX and AIX].

mount.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Junjiro Okajima]
        Removed erroneous statement about MS_RDONLY and bind mounts

open.2
    Jessica McKellar
        Fix grammar in O_DIRECT description
            Some small grammar fixes to the O_DIRECT description.

pipe.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Salvo Tomaselli]
        SYNOPSIS: Add "#include <fcntl.h>" for O_* constants
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=659750

sched_rr_get_interval.2
    Clemens Ladisch
        Update notes on modifying quantum
            Since Linux 2.6.24, it is no longer possible to
            modify the SCHED_RR quantum using setpriority(2).
            (Slight edits to Clemens' patch by mtk.)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reordered various pieces of text
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reworded text of ESRCH error

send.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add mention of sendmmsg(2)

sync.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Simone Piccardi]
        PROTOTYPE: Fix return type of syncfs()

vfork.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [starlight]
        Clarify what is duplicated in the child
            Add some words to make it clear to the reader that vfork(),
            like fork(), creates duplicates of process attributes
            in the child.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note clone() flags equivalent to vfork()
    Michael Kerrisk  [starlight, Mike Frysinger]
        Add some notes on reasons why vfork() still exists
    Michael Kerrisk  [starlight]
        Clarify that calling *thread* is suspended during vfork()
    Michael Kerrisk
        CONFORMING TO: Note that POSIX.1-2001 marked vfork() obsolete

        Document C11 and glibc 2.16 changes affecting gets()

pthread_sigmask.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Pat Pannuto]
        Fix comment that was inconsistent with code in example program

    Walter Harms
        EXAMPLE: Remove extraneous line of output from shell session

wcsnrtombs.3
wcsrtombs.3
wcstombs.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix-ups for e9c23bc636426366d659809bc99cd84661e86464

core.5
    Michael Kerrisk  [Junjiro Okajima]
        Document %E specifier for core_pattern

passwd.5
    Michael Kerrisk  [Walter Haidinger]
        s/asterisk/asterisk (*)/ to improve clarity
    Michael Kerrisk
        Correct note on passwd field value when shadowing is enabled
            When password shadowing is enabled, the password field
            contains an 'x' (not "*').

proc.5
    Elie De Brauwer
        Fix description of fourth field of /proc/loadavg

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=656994

feature_test_macros.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document _ISOC11_SOURCE

inotify.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Yang Yang]
        Note that 'cookie' field is set to zero when unused

man.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Various fixes for description of NAME section
            As noted by reporter:
            * The code sample given for the NAME section is incomplete because
              the actual content sample is not given.
            * Additionally, the description assumes that the item described is
              a command, which need not be the case.
            * The command makewhatis is not present on my system; the
              documented tool to create the whatis database is called mandb.
            * The description on .SH NAME in man(7) should either copy the
              relevant paragraph of lexgrog(1) or refer to it.

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

getent.1
    Mark R. Bannister
        New page to document 'getent' binary provided by glibc


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

bdflush.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that bdflush() is deprecated, and does nothing

nfsservctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that this system call was removed in Linux 3.1

ptrace.2
    Denys Vlasenko  [Oleg Nesterov, Tejun Heo]
        add extended description of various ptrace quirks
            Changes include:

            s/parent/tracer/g, s/child/tracee/g - ptrace interface now
            is sufficiently cleaned up to not treat tracing process
            as parent.

            Deleted several outright false statements:
            - pid 1 can be traced
            - tracer is not shown as parent in ps output
            - PTRACE_ATTACH is not "the same behavior as if tracee had done
              a PTRACE_TRACEME": PTRACE_ATTACH delivers a SIGSTOP.
            - SIGSTOP _can_ be injected.
            - Removed mentions of SunOS and Solaris as irrelevant.
            - Added a few more known bugs.

            Added a large block of text in DESCRIPTION which doesn't focus
            on mechanical description of each flag and operation, but rather
            tries to describe a bigger picture. The targeted audience is
            a person which is reasonably knowledgeable in Unix but did not
            spend years working with ptrace, and thus may be unaware of its
            quirks. This text went through several iterations of review by
            Oleg Nesterov and Tejun Heo.
            This block of text intentionally uses as little markup as possible,
            otherwise future modifications to it will be very hard to make.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global clean-up of page
            * Wording and formatting fixes to existing text and
              Denys Vlasenko's new text.
            * Various technical amendments and improvements to
              Denys Vlasenko's new text.
            * Added FIXME for various problems with the current text.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Integrated changes after further review from Denys Vlasenko

    Cyrill Gorcunov
        Document PR_SET_MM (new in Linux 3.3)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Various edits and improvements to Cyrill's patch


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

epoll_create.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework discussion of 'size' argument
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add .SS for description of epoll_create1()

epoll_wait.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Armin Rigo]
        Another thread can add to epoll instance while epoll_wait is blocked
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=43072
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that epoll_pwait() blocks calling *thread*
        A few wording improvements

fchmodat.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mike Frysinger]
        Note difference between glibc wrapper and underlying system call
            The wrapper function has a 'flags' argument (which currently
            serves no purpose), while the underlying system call does not.

fcntl.2
    Abhijith Das
        Explain behaviour of F_GETLEASE during lease break
    Michael Kerrisk  [Eric Blake]
        Change type of arg from "long" to "int"
            Various fcntl(2) commands require an integral 'arg'.
            The man page said it must be "long" in all such cases.
            However, for the cases covered by POSIX, there is an
            explicit requirement that these arguments be "int".
            Update the man page to reflect. Probably, all of the
            other "long" cases (not specified in POSIX) should
            be "int", and this patch makes them so. Based on a
            note fromEric Blake, relating to F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC.

gettimeofday.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reorganize content
            The main change is to move the historical information about
            the 'tz_dsttime' to NOTES.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Felix]
        Note that compiler issues warnings if 'tv' is NULL

mmap.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Kevin O'Gorman]
        Clarify that this system call should not be invoked directly
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42892
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify NOTES discussion of mmap() versus mmap2()

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Michael Welsh Duggan]
        Document negative value in 'fd' field
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document semantics of passing zero in 'events' field

ptrace.2
    Denys Vlasenko
        Various fixes
            For some reason, the PTRACE_TRACEME paragraph talks about some
            general aspects of ptraced process behavior. It repeats the
            "tracee stops on every signal" information even though that was
            already explained just a few paragraphs before. Then it describes
            legacy SIGTRAP on execve().

            This patch deletes the first part, and moves the second part up,
            into the general ptrace description. It also adds
            "If PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC option is not in effect" to the description
            of the legacy SIGTRAP on execve().

            The patch also amends the part which says "For requests other
            than PTRACE_KILL, the tracee must be stopped." - PTRACE_ATTACH
            also doesn't require that.

sigaction.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Andreas Jaeger, ]
        Clarify that the use of SI_SIGIO is for Linux 2.2 only
            See also http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6745

sigprocmask.2
    Mike Frysinger
        ERRORS: add EFAULT

times.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Simone Piccardi]
        ERRORS: Add EFAULT

div.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Reuben Thomas]
        CONFORMING TO: Add C99

fread.3
    Regid Ichira
        Clarify further that return value is number of items, not bytes
            See also http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=665780

getaddrinfo.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jak]
        Correct type of ai_addrlen field

malloc.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add malloc_usable_size(3)
        SEE ALSO: Add malloc_trim(3)

mallopt.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix text describing M_PERTURB and free()
        SEE ALSO: Add malloc_trim(3)

    Michael Kerrisk  [Reuben Thomas]
        Remove mention of terminating null in description of rawmemchr()

perror.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jesus Otero]
        Note that use of 'sys_errlist' is deprecated

rcmd.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        glibc eventually added a declaration of iruserok() in version 2.12

sysconf.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Ricardo Catalinas Jiménez]
        Add mention of _SC_SYMLOOP_MAX

nologin.5
    Michael Kerrisk  [Tetsuo Handa]
        nologin must not only exist, but *be readable* to be effective

nsswitch.conf.5
    Mark R Bannister
        Significant rewrites and improvements
            This patch applies to nsswitch.conf.5 in man-pages-3.36.

            My changes almost completely rewrite large sections of the
            man page. They are needed to add clarity, correct grammar,
            reduce confusion, and bring up-to-date with the latest glibc.
            I have checked the man page against the nss source code in
            glibc 2.14.90.

            Historical notes are demoted to the footer.

            The rewrite makes the man page much clearer to
            understand, more authoratitive, and easier to read.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Light edits to Mark Bannister's changes

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add prctl(PR_SET_MM) to CAP_SYS_RESOURCE

            See also https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=754611

unix.7

ld.so.8
    Jonathan Nieder  [Reuben Thomas]
        Document effect of hwcaps on search path
            Wording by Aurelien Jarno from Debian glibc's r4701 (2011-06-04).

        Note SPARC deviation with respect to get/set regs
            SPARC reverses the use of 'addr' and 'data' for
            PTRACE_GETREGS, PTRACE_GETFPREGS, PTRACE_SETREGS,
            and PTRACE_SETFPREGS.

send.2
    Stefan Puiu
        Document EACCES error case for UDP

sigaction.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove mention of raise(3) for SI_USER
            For a long time now, glibc's raise(3) didn't yield SI_USER
            for the signal receiver, so remove mention of raise(3)
            here. The user can deduce the details, if needed, by looking
            at the recently updated raise(3) page.

aio_cancel.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jon Grant]
        Rewrite RETURN VALUE section to be clearer

aio_init.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jon Grant]
        Remove extraneous "POSIX" from NAME section

btree.3
dbopen.3
hash.3
mpool.3
recno.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Brian M. Carlson]
        Note that glibc no longer provides these interfaces
            glibc stopped providing these interfaces with v2.2.
            Nowadays, the user that finds these pages probably wants
            the libdb API, so note this in the page.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=337581

fopen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        BUGS: Note limitation on number of flag characters parsed in 'mode'
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that 'c' and 'e' flags are ignored for fdopen()
            Determined from reading libio/iofdopen.c.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document ",ccs=string" feature of 'mode' for fopen()/freopen()

getgrnam.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Ulrich Drepper]
        Fix discussion of _SC_GETGR_R_SIZE_MAX
            The value is not meant to be a maximum (as was specified in
            SUSv3) but an initial guess at the required size
            (as specified in SUSv4).

getpwnam.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Ulrich Drepper]
        Fix discussion of _SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX
            The value is not meant to be a maximum (as was specified in
            SUSv3) but an initial guess at the required size
            (as specified in SUSv4).

malloc.3
mallopt.3
mtrace.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add mcheck(3)

memchr.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify description, omitting mention of "strings" and "characters"
            The existing text slipped into talking about characters and
            strings, which could mislead readers into thing that, for
            example, searches for the byte '\0' are treated specially.
            Therefore, rewrite in terms of "bytes" and "memory areas".

            At the same time, make a few source file clean-ups.

mkstemp.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add "mkstemps" and "mkostemps" to NAME line

posix_openpt.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Vadim Mikhailov]
        Add some details on use of the slave pathname
            An explicit pointer to ptsname(3) is useful, as is a note
            of the fact that the slave device pathname exists only as
            long as the master device is held open.

raise.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some notes on underlying system call that is used

rcmd.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some details of the rresvport() 'port' argument

resolver.3
    Petr Baudis
        Note that many options are documented in resolv.conf(5)

scandir.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Daniel J Blueman]
        Improve EXAMPLE source code: s/0/NULL/ in scandir() call

strchr.3
    James Hunt
        Explain behavior when searching for '\0'

strerror.3
    Eric Blake  [Stefan Puiu]
        Improve strerror_r() description
            POSIX requires that perror() not modify the static storage
            returned by strerror().  POSIX 2008 and C99 both require that
            strerror() never return NULL (a strerror() that always
            returns "" for all inputs is valid for C99, but not for POSIX).

            http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12204
            documents glibc's change to come into compliance with POSIX
            regarding strerror_r() return value.  The GNU strerror_r() use
            of 'buf' was confusing - I ended up writing a test program that
            proves that 'buf' is unused for valid 'errnum', but contains
            truncated "unknown message" for out-of-range 'errnum'.

            See also http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=382
    Bernhard Walle
        Correct description of error return for XSI strerror_r()
    Michael Kerrisk [Eric Blake]
        Note how to use 'errno' to detect errors when calling strerror()
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jon Grant]
        Add an example of the kind of string returned by strerror()

resolv.conf.5
    Petr Baudis
        Document "single-request" option

inotify.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note buffer size that guarantees being able to read at least one event
    James Hunt
        Correct description of size of inotify_event structure

iso_8859-1.7
    Eugen Dedu
        Add "-" for SOFT HYPHEN
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=156154

netdevice.7
    Brian F. G. Bidulock
        Document some SIOC configuration ioctls
            This patch adds common but missing SIOC configuration ioctls to
            the netdevice.7 manual pages that are not documented anywhere
            else. SIOCSIFPFLAGS and SIOCGIFPFLAGS are linux-specific. Flag
            values come from Linux 2.6.25 kernel headers for sockios. The
            others are standard BSD ioctls that have always been implemented
            by Linux and were verified from inspecting netdevice.c kernel
            code.

socket.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Alexey Toptygin]
        Correct description of SO_BROADCAST

tcp.7
    lepton
        Correct description for TCP_MAXSEG on modern kernel

CIRCLEQ_INSERT_TAIL.3
CIRCLEQ_REMOVE.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        New link to queue.3
            The queue(3) page documents these macros, so it makes sense to
            have links for the names.

DES_FAILED.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        New link to des_crypt.3
            The des_crypt(3) page documents this macro, so it makes sense

    Michael Kerrisk
        New link to qsort.3
            Overlooked to add this link in 3.38, when documentation of

    Michael Kerrisk  [Andries E. Brouwer]
        Clarify that these functions operate on bytes, not (wide) characters
            Change 'character(s)' to 'byte(s)' to make clear that these
            functions operate on bytes, not wide / UTF8 characters.
            (POSIX uses 'byte(s)' similarly, to make this point.)

icmp.7
ipv6.7
packet.7
raw.7
rtnetlink.7
unix.7
x25.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove names of constants from NAME line
            Some of the sockets/network protocol pages included names of
            the corresponding address family constants in the NAME line,
            but this wasn't done consistently across all pages, and probably
            it adds little value in those pages that did do this. So, remove
            these constants from those pages that have them in the NAME
            section.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

clock_getres.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Josh Triplett]
        Expand description of CLOCK_REALTIME
            Make it clear that this clock may be discontinuous, and is
            affected my incremental NTP and clock-adjtime(2) adjustments.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=540872

epoll_wait.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that 'timeout' is a *minimum* interval
            Make it clear that 'timeout' is a minimum interval; the actual
            interval will be rounded up to the system clock granularity,
            and may overrun because of kernel scheduling delays.

execve.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewording to deemphasize libc5 details

fork.2
    Mike Frysinger
        ERRORS: add ENOSYS

        Add RETURN VALUE and ERRORS sections
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer reader to NOTES for more info about 'tcache'

            See the April/May 2012 linux-man@ mail thread "[PATCH]
            Describe race of direct read and fork for unaligned buffers"
            http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.mm/77571

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that 'timeout' is a *minimum* interval
            Make it clear that 'timeout' is a minimum interval; the actual
            interval will be rounded up to the system clock granularity,
            and may overrun because of kernel scheduling delays.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify discussion of wrapper function emulation
            Clarify that glibc (as well as old libc) provides emulation
            using select(2) on older kernels that don't have a poll()
            system call.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make the meaning of a zero timeout explicit
            Clarify that timeout==0 causes an immediate return, even if
            no file descriptors are ready.

pread.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Kasper Dupont]
        BUGS: Note O_APPEND + pwrite() does the wrong thing
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=43178

recvmmsg.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that 'timeout' is a *minimum* interval
            Make it clear that 'timeout' interval will be rounded up to the

            scheduling delays.

select.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that 'timeout' is a *minimum* interval
            Make it clear that 'timeout' is a minimum interval; the actual
            interval will be rounded up to the system clock granularity,
            and may overrun because of kernel scheduling delays.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Expand description of the self-pipe trick
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add further details on pselect6() system call that underlies pselect()

semop.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that 'timeout' of semtimedop() is a *minimum* interval
            Make it clear that 'timeout' interval will be rounded up to the
            system clock granularity, and may overrun because of kernel
            scheduling delays.

signal.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that 'sig_t' requires _BSD_SOURCE
            Also remove some old Linux libc details

sigwaitinfo.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that 'timeout' of sigtimedwait() is a *minimum* interval
            Make it clear that 'timeout' is a minimum interval; the actual
            interval will be rounded up to the system clock granularity,
            and may overrun because of kernel scheduling delays.

stat.2
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        Formatting fixes
            From "groff -ww" (or "man --warnings=w ..."):

                warning: around line 442: table wider than line width

            GNU man uses line length of 78.

            Use text blocks.  Two spaces between sentences or better: start
            each sentence in a new line.

syscalls.2
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        Formatting fixes
            From "groff -ww ..." (or "man --warnings=w ..."):

                warning: around line 157: table wider than line width

            Have to use text blocks.  Move some text to its correct column.
            Split text to two columns to avoid hyphenation.

dbopen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SYNOPSIS: Add header file <fcntl.h>
            Upstreamed from Debian, and consistent with FreeBSD
            dbopen(3) man page.

fmemopen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note details of POSIX.1-2008 specification of 'b' in 'mode'
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rich Felker]
        BUGS: fmemopen() doesn't correctly set file position in some cases
            If 'mode' is append, but 'size' does not cover a null byte
            in 'buf', then fmemopen() incorrectly sets the initial file
            position to -1, rather than the next byte after the end of
            the buffer.

            See http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=13151
    Michael Kerrisk
        BUGS: fmemopen() incorrectly handles size==0 case
            If size is zero, fmemopen() fails, This is surprising behavior,
            and not specified in POSIX.1-2008.

            See http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11216

            Reported-by; Alex Shinn <alexshinn@gmail.com>
    Michael Kerrisk
        BUGS: Note silent ABI change for fmemopen() in glibc 2.9
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rich Felker]
        BUGS: Append mode does not force writes to append
            Append mode correctly sets the initial offset but does
            not force subsequent writes to append at end of stream.

            See http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=13152
    Michael Kerrisk  [Eric Blake]
        BUGS: Note inconsistent treatment of 'b' in 'mode'
            fopen() permits, for example, both "w+b" and "wb+",
            but only the latter is meaningful to fmemopen().

            See http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12836

fopencookie.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Petr Baudis]
        Correct description of return for user-supplied 'write' function
            See http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2074

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=660479

iconv.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Upstream useful NOTE from Debian
            Warn the reader that the pointer arguments can't be
            interpreted as C style strings. Also, note possible
            alignment requirements for the referenced bytes sequences,
    Michael Kerrisk
        Write a better paragraph introducing iconv() and its arguments

isgreater.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Vincent Lefevre]
        Clarify that the arguments to these macros must be real-floating
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=609033

lio_listio.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that async notification occurs when *all* I/Os complete

makedev.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SYNOPSIS: Correct return types of major() and minor()
            See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=754188

            Reported-by; Zdenek Kabelac <zkabelac@redhat.com>

            See https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/manpages/+bug/382096
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update CONFORMING TO for POSIX.1-2008
            POSIX.1-2008 doesn't change any details, but make
            that more explicit.

undocumented.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove some functions that have been documented

sd.4
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove reference to nonexistent scsi(4) page
            Upstreamed from RedHat / Fedora

sk98lin.4
    Michael Kerrisk  [Stephen Hemminger]

            or /usr/share/zoneinfo.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Drop SYNOPSIS
            The SYNOPSIS doesn't correspond to a user-visible file.
    Michael Kerrisk

        SEE ALSO: add tzset(3) and tzselect(8)

ascii.7
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        Indent for "troff" makes table too wide
            Fix following from "groff -t -ww ...":

                warning: around line 53: table wider than line width

            Extra indent for "troff" makes the table look misplaced
            (default "ps" output).

cp1251.7
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        table too wide
            From "nroff -ww -t ...":

                warning: around line 44: table wider than line width

            Columns are made narrower (column gutter decreased).

ipv6.7
    Stefan Puiu
        Add ENODEV error for bind() to link-local IPv6 address

signal.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Simone Piccardi]
        Clarify that SIGLOST is unused
    Michael Kerrisk
        Comment out crufty BUGS text on SIGLOST
            It must be a very long time since the statement there
            about SIGLOST was true. (The text seems to date back to
            1996.)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update architectures for tables of signal numbers

utf-8.7
    Brian M. Carlson
        Two clarifications
            This patch clarifies that 0xc0 and 0xc1 are not valid in any UTF-8
            encoding[0], and it also references RFC 3629 instead of RFC 2279.

            [0] In order to have 0xc0, you'd have to have a two-byte encoding
            with all the data bits zero in the first byte (and thus only six
            bits of data), which would be an ASCII character encoded in the
            non-shortest form.  Similarly with 0xc1.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=538641

ldconfig.8
nscd.8
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove path prefix from NAME line
            Command names shown in NAME are normally just the basename,
            not the full pathname of the command.

Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Sami Kerola
        Global fix: use UR macro where applicable
            The syntax .UR http://example.com paired with .UE will create
            links which one can interact, if the pager allows that.  One
            way to see the effect is ask the man(1) command to use browser
            display, e.g.:

                man -H man7/uri.7

            ("\:" is optional groff syntax to permit hyphenless line breaks.)

        Add note to SYNOPSIS that there is no glibc wrapper for system call
            Reduce the chance that the reader may be misled into thinking
            that there is a wrapper function for this system call by noting
            explicitly in the SYNOPSIS that there is no glibc wrapper and
            pointing the reader to NOTES for further details.

ioprio_set.2
    Colin McCabe
        Clarify the multithreaded behavior of ioprio_set(2)
    Michael Kerrisk  [Марк Коренберг, Kalle Olavi Niemitalo]
        Document who==0 for IOPRIO_WHO_PROCESS and IOPRIO_WHO_PGRP
            For IOPRIO_WHO_PROCESS, who==0 means operate on the caller.
            For IOPRIO_WHO_PGRP, who==0 means operate on the caller's
            process group.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=652443

migrate_pages.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Christoph Lameter, JoonSoo Kim]
        Fix description of return value

mount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        For MS_REMOUNT, source is ignored

mprotect.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rasmus Villemoes]
        'addr' argument is not const
            As reported by Rasmus:

                Both my system's man-pages (3.22) and the latest online
                (3.41) show:

                    int mprotect(const void *addr, size_t len, int prot);

                as the prototype for mprotect(2). However, POSIX [1] and the
                actual sys/mman.h (on all the systems I checked) do not have
                the const qualifier on the first argument.

msgctl.2
semctl.2
shmctl.2
svipc.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Don't mention that ipc_perm is defined in <sys/ipc.h>
            There's no need to mention that the 'ipc_perm' structure
            is defined in <sys/ipc.h>. That's an implementation detail,
            and furthermore <sys/ipc.h> is itself included by the other
            System V IPC header files. The current text might lead the
            reader to conclude that they must include <sys/ipc.h>, which
            is not the case (it is required neither on Linux, nor by the
            standards).

msgctl.2
msgget.2
msgop.2
semctl.2
semget.2
semop.2
shmctl.2
shmget.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: <sys/types.h> and <sys/ipc.h> aren't strictly needed
            Add text to NOTES to say that the <sys/types.h> and <sys/ipc.h>
            header files aren't required by Linux or the standards, but may
            be needed for portability to old systems.

ptrace.2
    Denys Vlasenko
        Explain WNOHANG behavior and EINTR bug
            I didn't like the "SIGKILL operates similarly, with exceptions"
            phrase (if it's different, then it's not "similar", right?),
            and now I got around to changing it. Now it says simply:
            "SIGKILL does not generate signal-delivery-stop and therefore
            the tracer can't suppress it."

            Replaced "why WNOHANG is not reliable" example with a more
            realistic one (the one which actually inspired to add this
            information to man page in the first place): we got
            ESRCH - process is gone! - but waitpid(WNOHANG) can still
            confusingly return 0 "no processes to wait for".

            Replaced "This means that unneeded trailing arguments may
            be omitted" part with a much better recommendation
            to never do that and to supply zero arguments instead.
            (The part about "undocumentedness" of gcc behavior was bogus,
            btw - deleted).

            Expanded BUGS section with the explanation and an example
            of visible strace behavior on the buggy syscalls which
            exit with EINTR on ptrace attach. I hope this will lead
            to people submitting better bug reports to lkml about
            such syscalls.

seteuid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note glibc version where setegid() implementation changed
            In glibc 2.2/2.3, setegid() switched from setregid() to setresgid().

set_tid_address.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rename 'ctid' argument for consistency with clone(2) page
    Michael Kerrisk
        Some rewordings and minor clarifications

sigwaitinfo.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Daniel Zingaro]
        Some wording clarifications
            Mainly rewording things like "is delivered" to "becomes pending",
            which is more accurate terminology.

syscall.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some more details to the description of syscall(2)
            And add another example of using syscall() to the program example.

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add kcmp(2)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move discussion of set_zone_reclaim(2) out of main table
            This system call was never visible to user space, so it makes
            sense to move it out of the main table of system calls into
            the notes below the table.

getifaddrs.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Adrian Dabrowski]
        Note that ifa_addr and ifa_netmask can be NULL

readdir.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jan Engelhardt]
        Handle -1 error from pathconf() in example code snippet
            Improve the example demonstrating allocation of a buffer
            for readdir_r() to handle -1 error return from pathconf().
            Otherwise, naive readers may think that pathconf() return
            value can be used without checking.

realpath.3
    Shawn Landden
        Use past tense with ancient history (libc4, libc5)

regex.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Correct SEE ALSO reference to glibc manual "regex" section

rtime.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jan Engelhardt]
        Fix broken pointer cast in example code

sem_close.3
sem_destroy.3
sem_getvalue.3
sem_init.3
sem_open.3
sem_post.3
sem_unlink.3
sem_wait.3
sem_overview.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that "cc -pthread" is required; "-lrt" no longer works
            See https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/manpages/+bug/874418

sigwait.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reword "is delivered" to "becomes pending"

strcat.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some text to emphasize the dangers of buffer overruns
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: Add discussion of strlcat()

strcpy.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that info is lost when strncpy() doesn't null terminate
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some text to emphasize possibility of buffer runs with strcpy()
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: Add a discussion of strlcpy()
            Inspired by https://lwn.net/Articles/506530/
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix description of the null-byte padding performed by strncpy()

tsearch.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: remove redundant discussion of unorthodox use of term "postorder"
            This point is already covered at greater length in the main
            text of the page (See the piece "More commonly, ...").
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify use for first argument to the twalk() 'action' function
            There's a number of details in POSIX that are omitted in
            the current version of this page.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Some wording fixes

core.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note effect of madvise(2) MADV_DONTDUMP flag

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND

glob.7
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        Change 8 bit characters to 7 bit representation
            Fixes rendering errors for accented 'a' characters.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Aaron Peschel]
        Update bash(1) command used to obtain classical globbing behavior
            The man page formerly noted the bash(1) v1 command to do this.

iso_8859-1.7
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        Explanation of SOFT HYPHEN and the code for it
            <groff: iso_8859-2.7>:89: warning: can't find special character `shc'

            This is the only "iso_8859-*.7" file that has this (now)
            undefined character.  The code in column four in "iso_8859-1.7" is
            "0x2D" ("HYPHEN, MINUS SIGN" or "HYPHEN-MINUS") instead of "0xAD".
            See Debian bug 156154 (or package "manpages").

            There should be an explanation for this graphic character and the
            code should be 0xAD in iso_8859-1.7 (as in all others), even
            though "[gn]roff" does not display a "HYPHEN" in that position of
            the table.

            The line with "SOFT HYPHEN" gets a footnote and a short
            explanation.

mdoc.7
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        Fixing a warning and a table
            Fis warning from "groff -ww ..." (or "man --warnings=w ..."):

                <groff: mdoc.7>:294: warning:
                tab character in unquoted macro argument

            In one table the distance between columns is too small in the
            "ps" output.  (Bug in the groff "doc.tmac" macro?)

mdoc.samples.7
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        Fix warnings from [ng]roff, corrections
            From "man -ww ..." (groff -ww ...):

                <standard input>:541: warning:
                tab character in unquoted macro argument
                [+3 similar warnings]
                <standard input>:813: warning: macro `Pu' not defined
                Usage: .Rv -std in sections 2 and 3 only (#1669)
                mdoc warning: A .Bl directive has no matching .El (#1821)

            String "Pu" defined as a row of punctuation characters.
            ".Bl" and ".El" fixed.
            Some arguments, that start with a period or are the name of a
            macro, protected with "\&".
            Variable name for macro ".Rv" corrected.

netdevice.7
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        Line in table too long
            Fix warning from "man ..." ("nroff -ww ..."):

                nroff: netdevice.7: warning: around line 98:
                table wider than line width

            Fix: No right adjustment in text blocks in tables.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=673873

netlink.7
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        Line in table is too long
            Fix warning from "man ..." ("nroff -ww ..."):

                nroff: netlink.7: warning: around line 195:
                table wider than line width

            Horizontal line incorporated into table.
            No right adjustment of text blocks in tables.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=673875
    Simon Paillard  [Herbert Xu]
        Change description of "*_pid" fields to "Port ID"
            As reported by Herbert Xu, these should not be considered as PIDs.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=383296

rtnetlink.7
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        Line in table too long
            Fix warning from "man ..." ("nroff -ww ..."):

                nroff: rtnetlink.7: warning: around line 415:
                table wider than line width

            Column gutter reduced to fit line length.
            Right adjustment in text blocks removed in tables.
            Some header made centered in tables.
            One table put on same page.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=674051

socket.7
    Martin H
        Document SO_MARK socket option
            Commit 4a19ec5800fc3bb64e2d87c4d9fdd9e636086fe0 in Jan 2008 added
            the new SO_MARK socket option.

            This patch is based on text from the commit message.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16461.

svipc.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SYNOPSIS: Remove include of <sys/types.h> and <sys/ipc.h>
            Including <sys/types.h> and <sys/ipc.h> isn't needed on Linux
            and isn't really relevant for the explanation on this page.

epoll_wait.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Fredrik Arnerup]
        Describe timeout limitation in kernels < 2.6.37
            As reported by Fredrik (and as far as I can tell the problem
            went back to 2.6.0):

            The timeout argument has an upper limit. Any values above that
            limit are treated the same as -1, i.e. to wait indefinitely.
            The limit is given by:

                #define EP_MAX_MSTIMEO min(1000ULL * MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT / HZ, \
                (LONG_MAX - 999ULL) / HZ)

            That is, the limit depends on the size of a long and the timer
            frequency.  Assuming the long is never smaller than 32 bits
            and HZ never larger than 1000, the worst case is 35 minutes.
            I think this should be mentioned under "BUGS".

            Although this is likely to be fixed in the future
            (http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/8/8/144), the problem exists in
            at least 2.6.14 - 2.6.35. I don't know if select(2) and poll(2)
            are affected.

            https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20762
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add pointer to select(2) for discussion of close in another thread

getitimer.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Trevor Woerner]
        Note Linux's odd handling of the new_value==NULL case
    Michael Kerrisk  [Trevor Woerner]
        Fix types used to declare fields in timeval struct

keyctl.2
    David Prévot
        Reorder SEE ALSO, without .br

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add pointer to select(2) for discussion of close in another thread

select.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Stephane Fillod]
        Note behavior if monitored file descriptor is closed in another thread
            Executive summary: a sane application can't rely on any
            particular behavior if another thread closes a file descriptor
            being monitored by select().

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40852
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify equivalent pselect() code in terms of threads
            s/sigprogmask/pthread_sigmask/

semop.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Recast discussion of blocking behavior in terms of threads
            semop() blocks the calling thread, not the process.
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: Add clone(2)
            Give reader a clue about CLONE_SYSVSEM.

shutdown.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Eric Dumazet]
        Document EINVAL error (and associated bug)
            Eric Dumazet noted that EINVAL was not documented. Some further
            digging shows that it's also not diagnosed consistently.
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=47111.

sigaction.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Tweak SA_RESETHAND description

timer_settime.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Small rewording around discussion of pointer arguments

wait4.2
    Adrian Bunk
        Note that these functions are nonstandard and recommend alternatives
            Some edits to Adrian's patch by mtk.
    Michael Kerrisk
        CONFORMING TO: Note SUS details for wait3()

gnu_get_libc_version.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove unneeded "#define _GNU_SOURCE" from SYNOPSIS

pthread_kill.3
pthread_sigqueue.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove wording "another"
            Writing "another thread" in these pages implies that these
            functions can't be used to send a signal to the calling thread
            itself, which is of course untrue.

sigvec.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add "int" arg to sv_handler definition in sigvec structure
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix small error in discussion of blocking of signals
            The signal that causes the handler to be invoked is blocked,
            but saying "by default" implies that this can be changed via
            the API. It cannot. (One needs sigaction(2) for that.)

syslog.3
    Simon Josefsson
        Remove (apparently bogus) text claiming LOG_AUTH is deprecated
            LOG_AUTH is in POSIX, and widely available. There
            seems to be no basis to the claim it is deprecated.

            Quoting Simon:
                I cannot find any other source that claim LOG_AUTH is
                deprecated in any way.  LOG_AUTH is distinct from
                LOG_AUTHPRIV.  The GNU C Library manual only documents
                LOG_AUTH.  The header files contains both without any
                comment.  Common systems like Debian appear to refer to
                both auth and authpriv facilities in syslog configurations.
                Popular daemons appear to use both facilities.
                Both facilities are discussed in several RFCs.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=46091

ttyname.3

        SEE ALSO: Add ctermid(3)

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify header file related to 'flags' field of /proc/PID/stat
    Michael Kerrisk  [Frédéric Brière]
        Update description of 'starttime' field of /proc/PID/stat
            The unit of measurement changed from jiffies to clock ticks in
            Linux 2.6.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=675891

ld.so.8
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe interpretation of slashes in dependency strings
    Michael Kerrisk
        Repeat note that LD_LIBRARY_PATH is ignored in privileged programs
            This point is already noted when discussing search order for
            libraries, but it's worth repeating under the specific discussion
            of LD_LIBRARY_PATH further down the page.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some details for LD_PRELOAD
        Note that LD_PRELOAD list separator can be space or colon

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

delete_module.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite to Linux 2.6+ reality
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change license and copyright
            There is now nothing left of the original FSF-copyrighted
            page. So, change the copyright and license.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Lucas De Marchi, Rusty Russell]
        Substantial reorganization after comments from Rusty Russell
            Rusty notes that O_NONBLOCK is almost always used in
            practice. Therefore, it would be better to reorganize
            the page to consider that "the default".

init_module.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite to Linux 2.6+ reality
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change copyright and license
            Little of the original page now remains. Change
            copyright and license
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rusty Russell]
        Changes after review comments from Rusty Russell
    Kees Cook

getauxval.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document getauxval() function added in glibc 2.16


Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: Use consistent capitalization in NAME section
            The line(s) in the NAME section should only use capitals
            where English usage dictates that. Otherwise, use
            lowercase throughout.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: "userspace" ==> "user space" or "user-space"
            Existing pages variously use "userspace or "user space".
            But, "userspace" is not quite an English word.
            So change "userspace" to "user space" or, when used
            attributively, "user-space".

    Michael Kerrisk
        Document /proc/meminfo
            Info mostly taken from Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt
            and Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Default for /proc/sys/fs/protected_{hardlinks,symlinks} is now 0
            The default setting of 1 in/proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks
            and /proc/sys/fs/protected_symlinks caused one too many
            breakages for Linus's taste, so commit 561ec64ae67e changed
            the default for both files to 0.
        Note system call error yielded by /proc/sys/fs/protected_symlinks
            Note that violating 'protected_symlinks' restrictions
            causes system calls to fail with the error EACCES.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since Linux 2.6.27, /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe depends on CONFIG_MODULES

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

clone.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since 2.6.30, CLONE_NEWIPC also supports POSIX message queues

delete_module.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Small rewording of description of effect of O_TRUNC

getrlimit.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Trevor Woerner]
        Document Linux's nonstandard treatment or RLIMIT_CPU soft limit
            Upon encountering the RLIMIT_CPU soft limit when a SIGXCPU handler
            has been installed, Linux invokes the signal handler *and* raises
            the soft limit by one second. This behavior repeats until the
            limit is encountered.  No other implementation that I tested
            (Solaris 10, FreeBSD 9.0, OpenBSD 5.0) does this, and it seems
            unlikely to be POSIX-conformant. The (Linux-specific)
            RLIMIT_RTTIME soft limit exhibits similar behavior.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Point reader at discussion of /proc/[pid]/limits in proc(5)

io_getevents.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        io_getevents() may cause segfault when called with invalid ctx_id
            For reference see: http://marc.info/?l=linux-aio&m=130089887002435&w=2

recv.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Eric Dumazet]
        UNIX domain sockets support MSG_TRUNC since 3.4

sendmmsg.2
    Elie De Brauwer
        Add example program for sendmmsg()

stat.2
    Simon Paillard
        Clarify description of EOVERFLOW error
            The EOVERFLOW error is not only for st_size, but also
            inode and block size fields. See glibc source file
            sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/xstatconv.c and kernel source
            file fs/stat.c. Also, fix bit/byte confusion
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=604928

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update various references to "i386" to "x86"

        Calls to sysctl() log warnings to the kernel log since 2.6.24

syslog.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Substantially reorganize discussion of commands
            Make the layout of the discussion of the commands
            more readable.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add kernel symbolic 'type' names
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify SYSLOG_ACTION_SIZE_UNREAD semantics
            SYSLOG_ACTION_SIZE_UNREAD returns the number of bytes
            available for reading via SYSLOG_ACTION_READ.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify where SYSLOG_ACTION_READ_ALL places data it reads
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify semantics of SYSLOG_ACTION_CLEAR
            The SYSLOG_ACTION_CLEAR command (5) does not really clear
            the ring buffer; rather it affects the semantics of what
            is returned by commands 3 (SYSLOG_ACTION_READ_ALL) and
            4 (SYSLOG_ACTION_READ_CLEAR).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify discussion of privileges for commands 3 and 10
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add mention of CONFIG_LOG_BUF_SHIFT

wait.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        BUGS: Document odd waitid() behavior when 'infop' is NULL

    Michael Kerrisk  [Julien Cristau]
        Update description of ifa_data to Linux 2.6+ reality
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=526778

memcmp.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jon Grant]
        Enhance RETURN VALUE text and remove redundant text from DESCRIPTION
            Note that sign of result equals sign of difference between
            first two bytes that differ (treated as "unsigned char")."

mkstemp.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Florian Weimer]
        Deemphasize discussion of mode 066 in glibc 2.0.6
            Glibc 2.0.6 is now so ld that the discussion of details
            of that version can be deemphasized placing just under
            NOTES.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=51811

strcmp.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jon Grant]
        Enhance RETURN VALUE text and remove redundant text from DESCRIPTION
            Note that sign of result equals sign of difference between
            first two bytes that differ (treated as "unsigned char")."

ttyname.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix confused text in ERRORS
            The existing text suggested that the ERRORS applied
            only for ttyname_r(). However, 2 of the 3 errors
            can occur for ttyname().

undocumented.3
    Michael Kerrisk

            In IPv4,IP_MTU is only supported by getsockopt.
            In IPv6, we can use IPV6_MTU to set socket's MTU,
            but the return value of getsockopt() is the path MTU.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

clone.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add kernel versions for various CLONE_* constants
    Michael Kerrisk
        CLONE_NEWIPC governs mechanisms that don't have filesystem pathnames
    Michael Kerrisk
        CLONE_NEWIPC doesn't mount the POSIX MQ file system
    Michael Kerrisk

    Michael Kerrisk
        Some reworking of CLONE_NEWIPC text
            No substantial content changes.
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add kcmp(2)
        SEE ALSO: add setns(2)

fallocate.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        FALLOC_FL_* flags are defined in glibc only since 2.18

getxattr.2
removexattr.2
setxattr.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Andrew Perepechko, ]
        Note that ENOATTR is a synonym for ENODATA
            Various people have pointed out that strace(1) shows ENODATA
            for the case where the named attribute does not exist, or
            the process has no access to this attribute. ENODATA
            and ENOATTR are in fact defined as synonyms. Point this out
            in the man page, so that people understand the strace(1) info.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=51871

getxattr.2
listxattr.2
removexattr.2
setxattr.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Put errors under ERRORS section
            The errno values on these pages were listed in a nonstandard
            way under the RETURN VALUE section. Put them in ERRORS sections.

init_module.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rusty Russell]
        ERRORS: Add errors for module signatures (EBADMSG, ENOKEY)

link.2
mkdir.2
mknod.2
open.2
rename.2
symlink.2
write.2
mkfifo.3
    Mark Hills
        Document EDQUOT error
            The return error EDQUOT is not documented in open(2), write(2),
            symlink(2) etc.

            Whether inodes or disk blocks are required for each function
            is something I based on received wisdom and BSD documentation,
            rather than tracing the code to the kernel. For symlink(2)
            this certainly depends on the file system type.

listxattr.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Theodore Ts'o]
        Fix RETURN VALUE description
            On success, 0 may be returned, so change wording from
            "positive number" to "nonnegative number".

outb.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add SYNOPSIS

prctl.2
    Kees Cook
        Document PR_SET_PTRACER
            Document the Yama LSM's prctl handler that allows processes to
            declare ptrace restriction exception relationships via
            PR_SET_PTRACER.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make it explicit that PR_SET_PTRACER replaces previous setting
            The attribute is a scalar, not a list.
    Shawn Landden
        Document EINVAL error for PR_SET_PTRACER
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document PR_GET_TID_ADDRESS

ptrace.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document PTRACE_O_EXITKILL
    Michael Kerrisk
        Place PTRACE_SETOPTIONS list in alphabetical order

query_module.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Must be called using syscall(2)
            Yes, the call is way obsolete, but add this info
            for completeness.

recvmmsg.2
    Elie De Brauwer
        Add/correct kernel version info for recvmmsg() and MSG_WAITFORNONE
            This patch isolates the since/version related fixes as requested.
            This change introduces the following delta:
             * The page states it was added in 2.6.32 but it is only added
                2.6.33 (ref: http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_33)
             * The MSG_WAITFORONE flag was in turn only added in 2.6.34

    Michael Kerrisk
        Add finit_module(2)

sysctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Garrett Cooper]
        ERRORS: EACCES as a synonym for EPRM
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=46731

        Remove crufty text about 'time_t' on "other systems"
            Back in 2006, some text came in via Debian patches that seems
            crufty. Remove it.

    Michael Kerrisk

core.5
proc.5
    Kees Cook
        Clarify suid_dumpable versus core_pattern
            In Linux 3.6, additional requirements were placed on core_pattern
            when suid_dumpable is set to 2. Document this and include commit
            references.
    Justin Lebar
        statm's "shared" field refers to pages backed by files
            I noticed that statm's "shared" field doesn't match the sum of
            all the "shared" entries in smaps [1].

            The kernel docs explain that statm's "shared" field is "number of
            pages that are shared (i.e. backed by a file)" [2].  smaps appears
            to call a page shared if it's mapped by at least two processes,
            which explains this discrepancy.

            I'm not a kernel hacker, but it appears to me they do mean "i.e."
            and not "e.g." in the statm description: In
            fs/proc/task_mmu.c::task_statm, I see

                *shared = get_mm_counter(mm, MM_FILEPAGES);

            Here's a patch which updates the man page to match the (hopefully
            correct) kernel docs.

posix_fallocate.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add fallocate(1)

regex.3
    Reuben Thomas
        Clarify details of matching
            The first is that it's far from clear that the end points of the
            complete string match are stored in the zero'th element of the
            regmatch_t array; secondly, the phrase "next largest substring
            match" is positively misleading, implying some sort of size
            ordering, whereas in fact they are ordered according to their
            appearance in the regex pattern.

scanf.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify meaning of "string conversions" for 'm' modifier
    Mike Frysinger

            POSIX.1-2008 adopted the 'm' flag for dynamic allocation. Update
            page to cover it and relegate the glibc-specific 'a' flag to
            NOTES.

Global changes
--------------

Many pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: remove unneeded double quotes in .SH headings

Many pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: remove unneeded double quotes in .SS headings

Many pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: use consistent capitalization in .SS headings
            Capitalization in .SS sections across pages (and sometimes even
            within a single page) is wildly inconsistent. Make it consistent.
            Capitalize first word in heading, but otherwise use lower case,
            except where English usage (e.g., proper nouns) or programming
            language requirements (e.g., identifier names) dictate otherwise.

Many pages
    Michael Kerrisk  [Denys Vlasenko]
        Remove double blank lines in output

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix order of SH sections


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

accept.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        NAME: Add "accept4"

access.2
    Colin Walters
        Note that access() may also fail for FUSE
            Since in some cases (e.g. libguestfs's guestmount) it also has the
            semantics where files can appear owned by root, but are actually
            mutable by the user, despite what one might infer from the Unix
            permissions.

getpeername.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Kai Kunschke]
        Clarify semantics of getpeername() for datagram sockets
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=674034

getuid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove duplicate section heading

mmap.2
    Cyril Hrubis
        Add note about partial page in BUGS section
            This adds a note about Linux behavior with partial page at the end
            of the object. The problem here is that a page that contains only
            part of a file (because the file size is not multiple of PAGE_SIZE)
            stays in page cache even after the mapping is unmapped and the file
            is closed. So if some process dirties such page, other mappings
            will see the changes rather than zeroes.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Török Edwin]
        Some 'flags' values require a feature test macro to be defined
            Add text to NOTES noting that some MAP_* constants are
            defined only if a suitable feature test macro is defined.
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=542601
    Cyril Hrubis
        Document EOVERFLOW error

open.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify list of file creation flags
            POSIX.1-2008 TC1 clarified this, so that O_CLOEXEC,
            O_DIRECTORY, and O_NOFOLLOW are also in this list.

prctl.2
    Cyrill Gorcunov
        Add some details for PR_GET_TID_ADDRESS

read.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Zack Weinberg]
        Clarify interaction of count==0 and error checking
            POSIX deliberately leaves this case open, so the man
            page should be less specific about what happens.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=533232
    Michael Kerrisk  [Marc Lehmann]
        Remove crufty text about O_NONBLOCK on files
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=700529
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify details for seekable files

unimplemented.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Peter Schiffer]
        Add various STREAMS interfaces to NAME
            Taken from Red Hat downstream.

            See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=436407

cexp2.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Still does not exist in glibc 2.17

exit.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that a call to execve() clears exit handler registrations

getaddrinfo.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: Add gai.conf(5)

malloc_trim.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove duplicate section title

printf.3
    Marshel Abraham  [Graham Gower, Graham Gower]
        Fix error handling in example code
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23282

pthread_yield.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Aristeu Rozanski]
        Add _GNU_SOURCE feature test macro to SYNOPSIS

resolver.3
resolv.conf.5
    Michael Kerrisk  [Nathan Stratton Treadway, Simon Heimberg]
        RES_DEBUG is only available if glibc is compiled with debug support
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=692136
            and https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=43061

strtol.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Peter Schiffer]
        Remove crufty text from previous fix

core.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document CONFIG_COREDUMP

capabilities.7
    Andrey Vagin
        Nonexistent bits are no longer shown as set in /proc/PID/status Cap*

inotify.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        A monitoring process can't easily distinguish events triggered by itself

ip.7
    Flavio Leitner  [Peter Schiffer]
        Improve explanation about calling listen() or connect()

man-pages.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe rules for capitalization in .SS headings

rtnetlink.7
    Pavel Emelyanov
        Add info about ability to create links with given index
            Since kernel v3.7 the RTM_NEWLINK message now accepts nonzero
            values in ifi_index field. Mention this fact in the respective
            rtnetlink.7 section.

socket.7
    Pavel Emelyanov
        SO_BINDTODEVICE is now readable
            SO_BINDTODEVICE is readable since kernel 3.8.

The following people contributed patches/fixes or (noted in brackets
in the changelog below) reports, notes, and ideas that have been
incorporated in changes in this release:

Michael Kerrisk <mtk.manpages@gmail.com>


Global changes
--------------

The goal of the changes below to consistently format copyright
and license information in the comments in the page source
at the top of each page. This allows for easy scripting to
extract that information. Following these changes the comments
the top of the page source should now consistently have the form:

    .\" <copyright info, possibly spread over several lines>
    .\"
    .\" %%%LICENSE_START(<license-type>)
    .\" <license text>
    .\" %%%LICENSE_END
    .\" <other comments>

Note that the 'license-type' is merely descriptive.  Its purpose is
to simplify scripting for the purpose of gathering statistics on
types of licenses used in man-pages.  It is NOT a statement about
the actual licensing of the page; that license is contain INSIDE the
LICENSE_START...LICENSE_END clause.

All pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add a LICENSE_START()...LICENSE_END clause in source at
        top of each page that encapsulates the license text.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Put copyright info at top of page, followed by blank line and LICENSE

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
         Update info in source comments on where to get a copy of the GPL

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove "Hey Emacs" comment in page source
            Only certain pages have this; there is no consistency, so
            remove it from all pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove "-*- nroff -*-" comment at top of source

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=643854

random.4
    Elie De Brauwer
        Document write and document the ioctl interface of /dev/random
            The update consists out of two parts:
             - a minor thing which just documents what happens if a write to
               /dev/(u)random is performed, which is used in the example
               script but not explicitly mentioned.
             - the other (biggest) part is the documentation of the ioctl()
               interface which /dev/(u)random exposes. This ioctl() lives in
               drivers/char/random.c and the primitives can be found in
               include/linux/random.h

            One comment remains, there used to be an RNDGETPOOL ioctl() which
            disappeared in v2.6.9. I found two patches on the net:
            - http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.8.1/2.6.8.1-mm4/broken-out/dev-random-remove-rndgetpool-ioctl.patch
            - https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/3/25/168

            But as far as I can tell the first one got applied but the 2nd
            one seems more correct. The result is that even today one can
            still find traces of the RNDGETPOOL ioctl() in the header files.
            Is this there for historical reasons or because it might break
            userspace, even though using it will just give an EINVAL.

bootparam.7
    Jose Luis Domingo Lopez
        Document 'rootfstype' option
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=182014

capabilities.7

        Add various pieces under CAP_SYS_RAWIO
            Info obtained by grepping the kernel source.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add CAP_SYS_RESOURCE /proc/PID/oom_score_adj case

proc.5
    Pavel Emelyanov

            This directory was added in Linux v3.3 and provides info about
            files being mmap-ed in a way very similar to how /proc/[pid]/fd
            works.

            v2: Added examples of how links look like and noted dependency
            on kernel config option CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document /proc/sys/kernel/shm_rmid_forced

Various System V IPC pages in Section 2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add "System V" to .TH line and text
            Make it clear that these pages relate to System V IPC,
            not POSIX IPC.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

access.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [The Wanderer]
        Clarify RETURN VALUE for F_OK
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=705293

alarm.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Correct the description of behavior when 'seconds' is 0

clone.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Peter Schiffer]
        Add prototype for syscall to SYNOPSIS
            And further clarify the distinction between the system call
            and the wrapper function in the introductory text.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update feature test macro requirements
            The requirements quietly changed in glibc 2.14

            See also http://www.sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4749
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mike Frysinger]
        Clarify differences between clone2() syscall and wrapper function
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mike Frysinger]
        Note those architectures where the sys_clone argument order differs
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mike Frysinger]
        Add short subsection noting that blackfin, m68k, and sparc are different
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move clone2() text to subsection in description
            The description of ia64 clone2() should follow the discussion
            of the raw system call interface.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change subhead for ia64 discussion

getcpu.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Recommend that 'tcache' should be specified as NULL nowadays

io_cancel.2
    Jeff Moyer, Michael Kerrisk  [Cyril Hrubis]
        Improve description

io_destroy.2
    Jeff Moyer
        Improve description
            The description was rather vague, citing a "list of I/O contexts"
            and stating that it "can" cancel outstanding requests.  This
            update makes things more concrete so that the reader knows exactly
            what's going on.

io_getevents.2
    Jeff Moyer
        The 'timeout' argument is not updated
            I looked back through the kernel code, and the timeout was
            never updated in any case.  I've submitted a patch upstream
            to change the comment above io_getevents.

io_setup.2
    Jeff Moyer
        Clarify nr_events
            nr_events is technically the number of completion events that can
            be stored in the completion ring.  The wording of the man page:
            "capable of receiving at least nr_events" seems dubious to me,
            only because I worry that folks might interpret that to mean
            'nr_events' total, instead of 'nr_events' concurrently.

            Further, I've added information on where to find the per-user
            limit on 'nr_events', /proc/sys/fs/aio-max-nr.  Let me know if
            you think that is not relevant.

        Add pointers to relevant /proc files described in proc(5)

posix_fadvise.2
pread.2
readahead.2
sync_file_range.2
truncate.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer to syscall(2) for ABI semantics on certain 32-bit architectures
            Also: in sync_file_range.2 and posix_fadvise.2 remove description
            of conventional calling signature as flawed, and in
            posix_fadvise.2, de-emphasize focus on ARM, and rather phrase
            as a more general discussion of certain architectures.

    Michael Kerrisk
        readdir(2) doesn't exist on x86-64

semop.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify the discussion of 'semadj'

shmctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer to proc(5) for description of /proc/sys/kernel/shm_rmid_forced

syscall.2
    Changhee Han
        Add notes that caution users when passing arguments to syscall()
            For example, passing 'long long' on ARM-32 requires special
            treatment.

        Document the exact calling convention for architecture system calls
    Mike Frysinger  [Kyle McMartin]
        Add PA-RISC details under calling conventions

umask.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add acl(5)

unshare.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update feature test macro requirements
            The requirements quietly changed in glibc 2.14

            See also http://www.sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4749

fopencookie.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Ralph Loader]
        Correct definition of cookie_io_functions_t

pthread_setname_np.3
    Andrew Clayton
        The thread argument is passed in by value

readir.3
seekdir.3
telldir.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Eliminate the implication that these functions deal with "offsets"
            The directory position dealt with by the readdir() and
            friends is not a simple file offset in modern file systems.
            Typically, it is some kind of cookie value. Add text and
            make other changes to these pages to eliminate the
            implication that this is an offset, and warn the reader
            that directory positions should be treated strictly as
            opaque values.

            In the process, rename the 'offset' argument of seekdir(3)
            to 'loc', and add some text to readdir(3) to note that
            the 'd_off' field is the same value returned by telldir(3)
            at the current directory position.

            The requirements quietly changed in glibc 2.14

            See also http://www.sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4749

ualarm.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Nicolas Hillegeer]
        Add note on the behavior when 'usecs' is zero
            POSIX.1-2001 does not specify the behavior in this case
            and no other system that I checked documented the behavior.
            Probably, most or all systems do what Linux does in this
            case: cancel any pending alarm, just as alarm(0) does.
            Add that info in NOTES.

elf.5
    Mike Frysinger
        Add byte positions for all EI_xxx fields
            When describing e_ident, most of the EI_xxx defines mention the
            exact byte number.  This is useful when manually hacking an ELF
            with a hex editor.  However, the last few fields don't do this,
            which means you have to count things up yourself.
            Add a single word to each so you don't have to do that.

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer to sched_rr_get_interval(2) for info on sched_rr_timeslice_ms
            Since Linux 3.9, /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rr_timeslice_ms can
            be used to change the SCHED_RR quantum.

    Krzysztof Konopko
        Simplify the example of printing out environ
            The binutils package contains a very handy utility to
            print out null-byte delimited strings from a file.  This
            can replace a rather complex expression with cat(1)
            provided as an example for printing out /proc/[pid]/environ.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update /proc/PID/maps example
            Update to 64-bit example that includes "[heap]", "[stack],
            and "[vdso]"
    Michael Kerrisk

ip.7
    Radek Pazdera
        Document IP_MULTICAST_ALL
            This commit adds documentation for the IP_MULTICAST_ALL socket
            option.

            The option was added to the Linux kernel in 2.6.31:

                Author Nivedita Singhvi <niv@us.ibm.com>
                Commit f771bef98004d9d141b085d987a77d06669d4f4f

            The description is based on a previous one [3] posted by the
            original author of the code -- Nivedita, but it is slightly
            re-worded.

            I tested it myself and it works as described.

units.7
    Brian M. Carlson
        units should use an actual µ
            The units(7) man page uses an ASCII u in place of the actual Greek
            letter mu.  Since we're in the twenty-first century, with
            UTF-8-compatible terminals and terminal emulators, we should use
            the actual letter µ instead of an ASCII approximation.

Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

perf_event_open.2
    Vince Weaver
        Add PERF_IOC_FLAG_GROUP documentation
            The perf_event_open() ENABLE/DISABLE/RESET ioctls can take an
            argument, PERF_IOC_FLAG_GROUP.  This wasn't documented at all
            until about a year ago (despite the support being there from
            the beginning) so I missed this when initially writing
            the man page.

socket.7
    Pavel Emelyanov, Michael Kerrisk
        Document SO_PEEK_OFF option
            Since Linux 3.4 there appeared an ability to specify the
            offset in bytes from which the data will be MSG_PEEK-ed.
            Describe this socket option in the socket(7) page, where
            all the other socket options are described.


Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Convert inline formatting (\fX...\fP) to dot-directive formatting

readdir.2
asprintf.
getline.3
getlogin.3
pthread_setname_np.3

strerror.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jon Grant]

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

execve.2
    Peter LaDow
       Add envp to the Linux notes about NULL pointers
            During the review of static analysis results, we discovered a
            functional, but non-portable, use of execve().  For example:

                char *cmd[] = { "/path/to/some/file", NULL };
                execve(cmd[0], cmd, NULL);

            The call succeeds.  Yet, the static analysis tool (rightly)
            pointed out that envp could be dereferenced.  But digging into
            glibc and the kernel, it appears that like argv, envp when NULL
            is treated as if it were an empty list.

            So, to clear things up, I'm submitting this patch to update the
            man page to indicate that envp is treated like argv.

fallocate.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        RETURN VALUE: mention that 'errno' is set on error

io_setup.2
    Cyril Hrubis  [Jeff Moyer]
        Clarify the nr_events parameter
            Currently the io_setup.2 man page describes what the kernel really
            does, i.e., that the resulting context may be able to hold more
            than the 'nr_event's operations because the memory allocated in
            kernel is rounded to be multiple of page size.

            It is better not to expose this implementation detail and
            simply state that the resulting context is suitable for
            'nr_events' operations.

perf_event_open.2
    Vince Weaver
        Clarify the perf_event_open() wakeup_events/wakeup_watermark fields
            Clarify the perf_event_open() wakeup_events/wakeup_watermark
            fields a bit, based on info from kernel commit cfeb1d90a1b1.
    Vince Weaver
        Update to match the Linux 3.10 release
            This patch updates the perf_event_open() documentation to include
            new interfaces added in the 3.10 kernel.

            It also documents a few [To be documented] instances left over
            from the 3.7 kernel.
    Vince Weaver
        Small correction to description of 'flags' argument

prctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note equivalents of PR_SET_NAME
            pthread_setname_np() and pthread_getname_np() and
            /proc/self/task/TID/comm provide access to the same
            attribute.

pread.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Марк Коренберг]
        pread() and pwrite() are especially useful in multithreaded applications

alloca.3
    Adrian Bunk
        Correct information on getting non-inlined version with gcc+glibc

pthread_attr_setscope.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Manuel Traut, Siddhesh Poyarekar]
        The inherit-scheduler attribute must be set to PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED
            In order for the attributes set by these functions to have
            an effect, the caller must use pthread_attr_setinheritsched(3)
            to set the inherit-scheduler attribute of the attributes object
            to PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED.

    Jérémie Galarneau
        copy the string returned by getenv()
            The example of a portable version of timegm() uses the string
            returned by getenv() after calling setenv() on the same
            environment variable. The tz string may be invalid as per
            getenv.3:

                    "The string pointed to by the return value of getenv()
                     may be statically allocated, and can be modified by a

    Regid
        Remove mention of the deprecated rdev(8)
            The deprecated rdev(8) command was removed from util-linux in 2010.
            See https://git.kernel.org/?p=utils/util-linux/util-linux.git;a=commit;h=a3e40c14651fccf18e7954f081e601389baefe3fO

clock_nanosleep.2
futex.2
nanosleep.2
poll.2
sigaction.2
sigreturn.2
signal.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add restart_syscall(2)

open.2
    Michael Kerrisk [Geoffrey Thomas]
        Remove warning that O_DIRECTORY is only for use with opendir(3)
            O_DIRECTORY can also be used with, for example, O_PATH.

perf_event_open.2
    Vince Weaver
        Improve PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_STACK documentation
    Vince Weaver
        Fix indentation of the MMAP layout section
            The indentation of the MMAP layout section wasn't quite right.
            I think this improves things but I admit I'm not an expert at the
            low-level indentation directives.
    Vince Weaver
        Update PERF_IOC_FLAG_GROUP info
            It turns out PERF_IOC_FLAG_GROUP was broken from 75f937f24bd9
            (in Linux 2.6.31, the initial perf_event release) until
            724b6daa1 (Linux 3.4).

            I've done some extensive kernel source code digging plus
            running tests of various kernels and I hope the info
            presented is accurate now.

            (Patch edited somewhat by mtk.)
    Vince Weaver
        Improve sysfs files documentation
            This improves the documentation of the various
            perf_event_open()-related sysfs files.

ptrace.2
    Denys Vlasenko  [Oleg Nesterov, Dmitry V. Levin]
        If SEIZE was used, initial auto-attach stop is EVENT_STOP
            For every PTRACE_O_TRACEfoo option, mention that old-style SIGSTOP
            is replaced by PTRACE_EVENT_STOP if PTRACE_SEIZE attach was used.

            Mention the same thing again in the description of
            PTRACE_EVENT_STOP.
    Denys Vlasenko  [Oleg Nesterov, Dmitry V. Levin]
        Mention that PTRACE_PEEK* libc API and kernel API are different
    Denys Vlasenko  [Oleg Nesterov, Dmitry V. Levin]
        Clarify PTRACE_INTERRUPT, PTRACE_LISTEN, and group-stop behavior

readlink.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document use of empty 'pathname' argument
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change error check in example program from "< 0" to "== -1"
    Chuck Coffing
        Fix possible race condition in readlink.2 example
            I noticed that the example in the readlink.2 man pages does error
            checking for a race condition that would cause the value of the
            symbolic link to get larger.  However, it doesn't handle the
            opposite case, in which the value gets shorter.  (The NULL
            terminator is always set at the old, longer offset.)  This could
            cause the program to operate on uninitialized data.

setpgid.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Graud]
        s/SIGTSTP/SIGTTIN/ when discussing reads from terminal
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60504

Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

ioctl_list.2
    Zsbán Ambrus
        Document FAT_IOCTL_GET_ATTRIBUTES
            The attached patch adds four ioctls from linux/msdos_fs.h to the
            ioctl_list(2) manpage.

            The ioctl FAT_IOCTL_GET_ATTRIBUTES reads FAT attributes of a
            file a mounted vfat file system.  I tested this on Linux
            2.6.33, an example script can be found at
            http://www.perlmonks.com/?node_id=832623


Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: s/file system/filesystem/
            Notwithstanding 24d01c530c5a3f75217543d02bf6712395e5f90c,
            "filesystem" is the form used by the great majority of man pages
            outside the man-pages project and in a number of other sources,
            so let's go with that.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

access.2
    J. Bruce Fields
        Fix outdated NFS information
            Note that NFS versions since version 3 support an "access" call
            so that the client doesn't have to guess permissions or ID
            mapping on its own.

            (See RFC 1813 sections 1.7 and 3.3.4.)

adjtimex.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: Add adjtimex(8)

clock_getres.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rodrigo Campos]
        Note circumstances in which "SMP" note applies.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add kernel version for CLOCK_*_CPUTIME_ID
            CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID and CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID
            appeared in 2.6.12.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add VERSIONS section

futex.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        The 'timeout' can be rounded upwards by clock granularity and also overrun

kill.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Small improvements to text on historical rules for permissions

nfsservctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note commands that were only in Linux 2.4.x and earlier

open.2
    Robert Harris
        Add mmap(2) to list of calls that fail when given an O_PATH descriptor
    Doug Goldstein
        Add EINVAL to errors list
            EINVAL can be returned by open(2) when the underlying filesystem
            doesn't support O_DIRECT. It is documented in the NOTES section
            but this patch adds it to the list of possible errors.

perf_event_open.2
    Vince Weaver
        PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_STACK updates
            This started out as just adding the new perf_event_open features
            from Linux 3.11 (which was the addition of transactional memory
            defines for PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_STACK samples) but turned into a
            general cleanup of the PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_STACK documentation.

            The main clarification is that at least one of the non-privilege
            values must be set or else perf_event_open() will return an EINVAL
            error.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reorder text describing fields of 'perf_event_header' structure
            Place the fields with the shorter descriptions first, to make the
            information easier to read.

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify wording of 'timeout' as a "minimum" interval

sched_setaffinity.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Christos Tsopokis]
        Clarify that these system calls affect a per-thread attribute

sched_setparam.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that this system call applies to threads (not processes)

sched_setscheduler.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that this system call applies to threads (not processes)

select.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [G.raud]

    Michael Kerrisk
        Wording improvements

    Johan Erlandsson
        Add missing argument in example
    Johan Erlandsson
        Correct registers for arm/EABI
            Registers was off by one.

        Clarify wording on "return value" when size==0

printf.3
    Christopher Hall
        Correctly describe the meaning of a negative precision
            The printf(3) manpage says that a negative precision is taken to
            be zero, whereas printf(3p) says that a negative precision is
            taken as if the precision were omitted.  glibc agrees with the
            latter (POSIX) specification.

            Test code:

                printf("%f\n",42.0);      // "42.000000"
                printf("%.*f\n",0,42.0);  // "42"
                printf("%.*f\n",-1,42.0); // "42.000000"

            This patch corrects the explanation to match what actually happens.

            Attempt to document fields in the /proc/[pid]/io file, based on
            the Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt. The text will probably
            need some grammar corrections.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Marko Myllynen]
        /proc/sys/fs/inode-max went away in Linux 2.4
            Also, the 'preshrink' field in /proc/sys/fs/inode-state became
            a dummy value in Linux 2.4.

rexec.3
rpc.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jon Grant]
        Reword a sentence to use more gender-neutral language


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

execve.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        'arg...' for interpreter scripts starts with argv[1]

fallocate.2
    Christoph Hellwig
        Clarify the zeroing behavior
            fallocate() zeroes only space that did not previously contain
            data, but leaves existing data untouched.

futex.2
    Rodrigo Campos
        Fix link to Rusty's futex example library
            When I asked to webmaster@kernel.org, Konstantin Ryabitsev
            answered that the ".nl." is "an obsolete scheme and really
            should be changed to just ftp.kernel.org".

getgroups.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that NGROUPS_MAX is defined in <limits.h>
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that sysconf(_SC_NGROUPS_MAX) is a run-time technique
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document /proc/sys/kernel/ngroups_max

ioctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [KOSAKI Motohiro, David Gibson]
        'request' argument is typed as 'unsigned long' in glibc
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42705

perf_event_open.2
    Vince Weaver
        Linux 3.12 rdpmc/mmap
            It turns out that the perf_event mmap page rdpmc/time setting was
            broken, dating back to the introduction of the feature.  Due
            to a mistake with a bitfield, two different values mapped to
            the same feature bit.

            A new somewhat backwards compatible interface was introduced
            in Linux 3.12.  A much longer report on the issue can be found
            here:
               https://lwn.net/Articles/567894/
    Vince Weaver
        Linux 3.12 adds PERF_SAMPLE_IDENTIFIER
            A new PERF_SAMPLE_IDENTIFIER sample type was added in Linux 3.12.
    Vince Weaver
        E2BIG documentation
            The following documents the E2BIG error return for
            perf_event_open().

            I actually ran into this error the hard way and it took me
            half a day to figure out why my ->size value was changing.
    Vince Weaver
        Linux 3.12 adds PERF_EVENT_IOC_ID
            A new perf_event related ioctl, PERF_EVENT_IOC_ID, was added
            in Linux 3.12.
    Vince Weaver
        PERF_COUNT_SW_DUMMY support
            Support for the PERF_COUNT_SW_DUMMY event type was added in
            Linux 3.12.
    Vince Weaver  [Andreas Sandberg]
        PERF_EVENT_IOC_PERIOD update
            The PERF_EVENT_IOC_PERIOD ioctl was broken until 2.6.36,
            and it turns out that the ARM architecture has some
            differing behavior too.

pipe.2
    Trevor Bramwell
        Fix error in example program

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Paolo Bonzini]
        Clarify meaning of events==0
            events==0 does not mean that revents is always returned as
            zero. The "output only" events (POLLHUP, POLLERR, POLLNVAL)
            can still be returned.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=61911

readlink.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Yuanhang Zheng]
        Fix typo in error message in example program

recv.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove out-of-date statement that UNIX domain does not support MSG_TRUNC
            Should have removed that sentence as part of
            commit a25601b48b822eb1882ae336574b8d062a17e564

sched_get_priority_max.2

    Michael Kerrisk
        Note filesystem support for nanosecond timestamps
            Add some detail on which native filesystems do and don't
            support nanosecond timestamps.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Cosmetic reworking of timestamp discussion in NOTES
    Michael Kerrisk  [Yang Yang]
        Update discussion of nanosecond timestamps
            The existing text describes the timestamp fields as 'time_t'
            and delegates discussion of nanosecond timestamps under NOTES.
            Nanosecond timestamps have been around for a while now,
            and are in POSIX.1-2008, so reverse the orientation of the
            discussion, putting the nanosecond fields into DESCRIPTION
            and detailing the historical situation under NOTES.

symlink.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Further fine tuning of argument names
            Follow-up to f2ae6dde0c68448bec986d12fe32268a2c98bfd9
            See https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16073

kcmp.3
    Shawn Landden
        Reword slightly awkward section

malloc.3
    Greg Price
        Scale back promises of alignment
            It's not true that the return value is suitably aligned for "any
            variable"; for example, it's unsuitable for a variable like
              float *x __attribute__ ((__vector_size__ (32)));
            which requires 32-byte alignment.  Types like this are defined in
            <avxintrin.h>, and with 16-byte alignment in <emmintrin.h> and
            <xmmintrin.h>, so the application programmer need not even know
            that a vector_size attribute has been applied.

            On an x86 architecture, a program that loads from or stores to a
            pointer with this type derived from malloc can crash because GCC
            generates an aligned load/store, like MOVDQA.

            The C99 standard (TC3, as of N1256) does say the return value is
            suitably aligned for "any type of object".  The C11 standard (as
            of N1570) revises this to any type with "fundamental alignment",
            which means an alignment "supported by the implementation in all
            contexts", which I suppose tautologically includes aligning
            malloc/realloc return values.

            The actual behavior of current glibc malloc is to align to the
            greater of 2 * sizeof(size_t) and __alignof__ (long double),
            which may be one bit greater than this commit promises.

mq_receive.3

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

fgetc.3
gets.3
    David Malcolm
        Split gets(3) to isolate unsafe gets(3) to a page on its own
            Currently man3/gets.3 documents various safe I/O functions, along
            with the toxic "gets" function.

            At the risk of being melodramatic, this strikes me as akin to
            storing rat poison in a food cabinet, in the same style of
            packaging as the food, but with a post-it note on it saying
            "see warnings below".

            I think such "never use this" functions should be quarantined
            into their own manpages, rather than listing them alongside
            sane functions.

            The attached patch does this for "gets", moving the documentation
            of the good functions from man3/gets.3 into man3/fgetc.3,
            updating the SO links in the relevant functions to point at the
            latter.

            It then rewrites man3/gets.3 to spell out that "gets" is toxic
            and should never be used (with a link to CWE-242 for good
            measure).
    Michael Kerrisk  [Andre Majorel]
        Tweaks to David Malcolm's patch

vdso.7
    Mike Frysinger
        New page documenting the vDSO mapped into each process by the kernel


Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

reboot.2
    Elie De Brauwer
        Document LINUX_REBOOT_SW_SUSPEND


New and changed links
---------------------

fgets.3
getc.3
getchar.3
ungetc.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Adjust links to gets(3) to point to fgetc(3)


Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix of "NULL pointer"
            Change "NULL pointer" to "NULL" or null pointer".
            POSIX uses the term "null pointer", not "NULL pointer".

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Stylistic changes to code example
            For ease of reading, don't embed assignments inside if().

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Replace uses of "i.e.," in main text with "that is" or similar
            Usual man-pages style is to use "i.e." only within
            parenthetical expressions.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Replace uses of "e.g." in main text with "for example" or similar
                Usual man-pages style is to use "e.g." only within
                parenthetical expressions.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add "Program source" subheading under EXAMPLE

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add "static" to global variables and functions in example program


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

clock_getres.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Nadav Har'El]
        Improve description of CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=67291

close.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [P?draig Brady]
        Note that errors from close() should be used only for diagnosis
            In particular, retrying after EINTR is a bad idea.

            See http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=529

            See http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.glibc.alpha/37702
            Subject: [RFC][BZ #14627] Make linux close errno to EINPROGRESS
                     when interrupted in signal.

execve.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Marco Dione]
        Add further cases to EFAULT error
            See https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16402

perf_event_open.2
    Vince Weaver  [Sudhanshu Goswami]
        Clarify issues with the disabled bit
            Clarify the perf_event_open behavior with respect to the disabled
            bit and creating event groups.
    Vince Weaver  [Sudhanshu Goswami]
        Clarify issues with the exclusive bit
            Warn that using the perf_event_open "exclusive" bit, while
            it might seem like a good idea, might lead to all 0 results
            in some common usage cases.

reboot.2
    Elie De Brauwer
        Mention RB_POWER_OFF
            The manpage did not mention RB_POWER_OFF which is the glibc
            symbolic name for LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_POWER_OFF.

            $ cd /usr/include
            $ cat x86_64-linux-gnu/sys/reboot.h | grep POWER_OFF
             define RB_POWER_OFF        0x4321fedc
    Elie De Brauwer
        Add "Linux" to kernel version numbers
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add RB_SW_SUSPEND synonym
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add RB_KEXEC synonym

setpgid.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Joseph S. Myers]
        BSD getpgrp() and setpgrp() go away in glibc 2.19

socket.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Dongsheng Song]
        Remove crufty statement that AF_INET does not support SOCK_SEQPACKET
            Linux AF_INET supports SOCK_SEQPACKET via SCTP.

syscall.2
    Mike Frysinger
        Fix ia64 registers
            The original list of registers was created by confusing strace
            source code--this is for parsing legacy 32-bit code (which is
            dead and no one cares). Update the list to reflect native ia64
            syscall interface.

syscall.2
syscalls.2
getauxval.3
    Mike Frysinger
        Add references to new vdso(7) page

utimensat.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Small wording improvement for times!=NULL case

dlopen.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mike Frysinger]
        Update remarks on cast needed when assigning dlsym() return value
            POSIX.1-2013 eases life when casting the dlsym() return value to a
            function pointer
    Michael Kerrisk  [Stephen Kell]
        Fix description of dli_sname
            See https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16262

getline.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Luke Hutchison]
        Correct description of how '*n' is used when '*lineptr' == NULL
            See https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5468
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove SEE ALSO reference to unsafe gets(3)

mcheck.3
    Simon Paillard  [Raphael Geissert]
        typo in compiler flag
            See http://bugs.debian.org/732464

mkstemp.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Janne Blomqvist]
        Better describe 'flags' that can be specified for mkostemp()

printf.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Arif Zaman]
        Fix memory leak in snprintf() example
            See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19933479/snprintf-man-page-example-memory-leak

pthread_kill.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mathieu Desnoyers]
        POSIX.1-2008 removes ESRCH
            POSIX.1-2001 mistakenly documented an ESRCH error, and
            POSIX.1-2008 removes this error. Glibc does return
            this error in cases where it can determine that a thread ID
            is invalid, but equally, the use of an invalid thread ID
            can cause a segmentation fault.

puts.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: replace reference to gets(3) with fgets(3)

        BSD sigpause() goes away in glibc 2.19
    Michael Kerrisk
        Correct feature text macro requirements

        ATTRIBUTES: Note functions that are thread-safe
            The functions sincos(), sincosf() and sincosl() are thread safe.

string.3
    Moritz 'Morty' Strübe
        Add short description of the functions
            It is helpful to have a short description about what the different
            functions in string.h do.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fixes and enhancements to Moritz Strübe's patch

strptime.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mathieu Malaterre, Simon Paillard]
        Add number ranges to comments in 'tm' structure
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=729570

strspn.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mathieu Malaterre]
        Improve description in NAME
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=723659

            a "coding:" marker to the groff source. For now, we'll only put
            that marker on pages that contain non-ASCII characters in the

been queued for a while: merging the text of the man pages for the
*at([23]) ("directory file descriptor") APIs into their corresponding
traditional pages.  When the *at([23]) pages were originally written
(mostly in 2006), the APIs were not part of POSIX and (in most cases)
were not available on other systems. So, it made some sense to wall
them off into their own separate pages. Eight years later, with the
APIs now all in POSIX (except scandirat()), it is much more sensible
to document the newer APIs alongside their traditional counterparts,
so that the newer APIs are not "hidden", and the reader can more
easily see the differences between the APIs.

Thus, the text of 14 pairs of pages has been merged, and the "merged
from" pages have been converted to links to the "merged to" pages.
Along the way, a few other fixes were made to the pages, as noted
below.

One page that did not undergo such a change was utimensat(2), which
is different enough from utime(2) that it warrants a separate page.
Unlike the other *at() pages, the utimensat(2) page was also already
self-contained, rather than defining itself in terms of differences
from utime(2) as the other *at() pages did.

        Make it clearer that glibc and syscall APIs differ for PTRACE_PEEK*
            Thanks to Denys Vlasenko's additions in 78686915aed6bd12
            this page does note that the glibc API for PTRACE_PEEK*
            differs from the raw syscall interface. But, as the report
            at https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=70801 shows,
            this information could be more obvious. This patch makes its so.

resolv.conf.5
    Carlos O'Donell
        DESCRIPTION: mention that the data is trusted
            In a recent discussion about DNSSEC it was brought to my
            attention that not all system administrators may understand
            that the information in /etc/resolv.conf is fully trusted.
            The resolver implementation in glibc treats /etc/resolv.conf
            as a fully trusted source of DNS information and passes on
            the AD-bit for DNSSEC as trusted.

            This patch adds a clarifying sentence to make it absolutely
            clear that indeed this source of information is trusted.

Removed Pages
-------------

sync.8
    Michael Kerrisk  [Christoph Hellwig, Pádraig Brady]
        Sometime in the 20th century (before my watch), a sync(8)
        page into man-pages. It documents the sync command from
        "fileutils", which long ago become coreutils, and the
        piece under NOTES note some behavior of sync(2)
        that ceased to be true many years ago.  The man-pages
        project generally focuses on only Linux kernel and
        (g)libc interfaces, so this sync(8) page doesn't really
        belong.  Furthermore, coreutils has a sync(1) page which
        covers the same command. After discussions on the
        coreutils list, I've decided to retire this page from
        man-pages.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

clone.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that CLONE_THREAD also in effect requires CLONE_VM

stat.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Marius Gaubas]
        Warn the reader that the 'stat' structure definition is not precise
            Padding fields aren't shown, and the order of fields varies
            somewhat across architectures.

gethostbyname.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove redundant FTM requirements
            _GNU_SOURCE implies _SVID_SOURCE and _BSD_SOURCE, so

                _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _GNU_SOURCE

            is the same as

                _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE

feature_test_macros.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        _BSD_SOURCE and _SVID_SOURCE are deprecated in glibc 2.20
    Michael Kerrisk
        _GNU_SOURCE implicitly defines other macros
            Saying that _GNU_SOURCE has the "effects of" other macros is not
            quite precise.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reword glibc version for _ISOC95_SOURCE
    Michael Kerrisk
        _ISOC99_SOURCE also exposes C95 definitions
    Michael Kerrisk
        _ISOC11_SOURCE implies the effects of _ISOC99_SOURCE
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note version number for _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L implies C99/C95
            _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L causes C95 definitions to be
            exposed only since glibc 2.12 and C99 definitions only
            since 2.10.
    Michael Kerrisk

            were later specified in POSIX.1-2008, namely:

                   isalnum_l()
                   isalpha_l()

mount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add blkid(1)

msgop.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document two MSG_COPY failure modes
            Since Linux 3.14, the kernel now diagnoses two errors
            when using msgrcv() MSG_COPY:
            * MSG_COPY must be specified with IPC_NOWAIT
            * MSG_COPY can't be specified with MSG_EXCEPT

open.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Organize some material under additional subheadings in NOTES
            There's an amorphous mass of material under NOTES.  Structure
            it with some subheadings, and do a little reorganizing.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add other system calls and functions that are like openat()
            fanotify_mark(2), name_to_handle_at(2), and scandirat(3) have a
            directory file descriptor argument for the same reason as openat().
            Also: reword the rationale for the *at() functions somewhat.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify ELOOP error interaction with O_PATH

readahead.2
    Phillip Susi  [Corrado Zoccolo, Gregory P. Smith, Zhu Yanhai, Michael Kerrisk, Christoph Hellwig]
        Don't claim the call blocks until all data has been read
            The readahead(2) man page was claiming that the call blocks until
            all data has been read into the cache.  This is incorrect.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54271

stat.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add ls(1) and stat(1)

fts.3
    Christoph Hellwig  [Michael Kerrisk]
        The fts(3) API does not work with LFS builds
            As pointed out during a recent discussion on libc-hacker the
            fts(3) APIs can't be used with large file offsets:

                https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=15838

toupper.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite to more explicitly bring locales into the discussion
    Michael Kerrisk
        Retitle BUGS section to NOTES

feature_test_macros.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Joseph S. Myers]
        Remove mention of bogus _ISOC95_SOURCE macro
            The _ISOC95_SOURCE macro is defined in <features.h>, but it
            does nothing. So remove discussion of it, and move some of
            the discussion of C95 under the _ISOC99_SOURCE subhead.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Carlos O'Donell]
        Add packaging note for _BSD_SOURCE/_SVID_SOURCE/_DEFAULT_SOURCE
            To compile warning-free across glibc < 2.20 and glibc >= 2.20
            code may been to define both _DEFAULT_SOURCE and either
            _BSD_SOURCE or _SVID_SOURCE.

        Reword description of C90

locale.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add subsection on POSIX.1-2008 (originally GNU) extensions to locale API
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove reference to LI18NUX2000
            LI18NUX2000 is difficult to even find these days, and in any case
            this page does not document gettext(), so notes about gettext()
            in the CONFORMING TO section here make no sense.
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add mbstowcs(3) and wcstombs(3)

            There are fewer and fewer systems these days that don't
            support the %z specifier mandated in C99.  So replace the

        Fix error in discussion of MIN > 0, TIME == 0 noncanonical mode
            As reported by Peter Hurley, for the MIN > 0, TIME == 0 case:

                read() may unblock when MIN bytes are available but return
                up to the 'count' parameter if more input arrives in between
                waking and copying into the user buffer.
                ...
                read() may also _not_ return until MIN bytes have been
                received, even if 'count' bytes have been received.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add a note on interaction of O_NONBLOCK with noncanonical MIN/TIME
            POSIX leaves the behavior open.

    Michael Kerrisk
        name_to_handle_at(2) and open_by_handle_at(2) optionally follow symlinks
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention use of readlink(2) to read contents of a symlink

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

fanotify_init.2
    Heinrich Schuchardt, Michael Kerrisk
        New page documenting fanotify_init(2)

fanotify_mark.2
    Heinrich Schuchardt, Michael Kerrisk
        New page documenting fanotify_mark(2)

sched_setscheduler.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Page rewritten
            Stripped out the general scheduling material, which
            moved to sched(7), and rewrote much of the remainder.
            Changed copyright and license since pretty much all
            of the content was or is written by mtk.

fanotify.7
    Heinrich Schuchardt, Michael Kerrisk
        New page providing overview of the fanotify API

sched.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        New page providing an overview of the scheduling APIs
            Most of this content derives from sched_setscheduler(2). In
            preparation for adding a sched_setattr(2) page, it makes
            sense to isolate out this general content to a separate
            page that is referred to by the other scheduling pages.


Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

fallocate.2
    Lukas Czerner [Michael Kerrisk]
        Document FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE
            FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE was added in Linux 3.14,
            for zeroing ranges in the allocated space in a file.

rename.2
    Miklos Szeredi [Michael Kerrisk]
        Document renameat2() system call added in Linux 3.15

shmop.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document SHM_EXEC


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

flock.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Employ term "open file description" in DESCRIPTION
            And include reference to open(2) for an explanation of the term.

getpriority.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add sched(7)

getsockopt.2
    Carsten Andrich
        SEE ALSO: add packet(7)

link.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Steven Stewart-Gallus]
        Document ENOENT error for linkat()
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=73301

msgget.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reword EEXIST error

msgop.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note capability required to raise MQ size beyond MSGMNB

msync.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Heinrich Schuchardt]
        s/flushes... back to disk/flushes... back to filesystem/

nice.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add sched(7)

open.2
    Peter Schiffer
        Update note on alignment of user buffer and file offset for O_DIRECT
            The sentence in open(2) man page in notes for O_DIRECT flag:

                "Under Linux 2.6, alignment to 512-byte boundaries suffices."

            is not universally correct. The alignment is a property of the
            storage, for example, 4k-sector drives with no 512 byte sector
            emulation will be unable to perform 512-byte direct I/O.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note some of the various synonyms for "open file description"
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove repetitious text on use of fcntl() to change file status flags

open_by_handle_at.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention FreeBSD analogs

posix_fadvise.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Eric Siegerman]
        Fix wording error under "Architecture-specific variants"
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=75431

        Add feature test macro requirements
            The _GNU_SOURCE FTM must be defined.

read.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        BUGS: detail nonatomicity bug with respect to file offset updates
            This bug was fixed in Linux 3.14, with commit
            9c225f2655e36a470c4f58dbbc99244c5fc7f2d4
            See also http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1649458

    Michael Kerrisk
        Small changes consistent with migration of content to sched(7)

sched_setaffinity.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Small changes consistent with migration of content to sched(7)

sched_setparam.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Small changes consistent with migration of content to sched(7)

sched_yield.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Small changes consistent with migration of content to sched(7)

semget.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Consolidate discussion on noninitialization of semaphores
            The fact that semget() does not initialize the semaphores
            in a new set was covered in two places (in DESCRIPTION
            and BUGS). Consolidate these into one place (in NOTES)
            and also point out that POSIX.1-2008 says that a future
            version of the standard may require an implementation to
            initialize the semaphores to 0.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify SEMMNS versus SEMMSL*SEMMNI
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework EINVAL text a little
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify wording for EEXIST error

shmget.2
    Manfred Spraul
        Clarify SHMALL
            The default for SHMALL is a limit of 8 GB, regardless of
            PAGE_SIZE. The current documentation does not mention that
            and is therefore more difficult to understand than necessary.
    Manfred Spraul
        Correct math error
            2097152 is 2^21, not 2^20.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reword EEXIST error
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify one of the EINVAL cases

        Fix kernel version numbers in discussion of SHMALL
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework EINVAL text
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move and rework discussion of mode bits
    Michael Kerrisk

    Michael Kerrisk
        Add subheads for shmat() and shmdt()
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework discussion of SHM_RDONLY and SHM_REMAP into list format
    Michael Kerrisk
        Structure the attach cases as a list

sigaction.2
    Alan Curry
        Fix bad cross reference (times(2) not time(2))
            The system call that reports child CPU usage is times(2),
            not time(2).

symlink.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Steven Stewart-Gallus]
        Document ENOENT error for symlinkat()
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=73301

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add renameat2()
            And bump kernel version.

    Peng Haitao
        ATTRIBUTES: Note functions that are thread-safe
            The functions pthread_attr_setschedparam() and
            pthread_attr_getschedparam() are thread safe.

    Peng Haitao
        ATTRIBUTES: Note functions that are thread-safe
            The functions pthread_attr_setschedpolicy() and
            pthread_attr_getschedpolicy() are thread safe.

pthread_attr_setscope.3
    Peng Haitao
        ATTRIBUTES: Note functions that are thread-safe
            The functions pthread_attr_setscope() and pthread_attr_getscope()
            are thread safe.

    Peng Haitao
        ATTRIBUTES: Note functions that are thread-safe
            The functions pthread_attr_setstack() and pthread_attr_getstack()
            are thread safe.

sched_getcpu.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add sched(7)

termios.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Yuri Kozlov]
        Rework intro text for 'c_oflag'
    Michael Kerrisk
        OFDEL is in POSIX.1-2001, so remove "(Not in POSIX)" text

    Jan Moskyto Matejka  [Randy Dunlap]
        Improve description of /proc/stat 'intr' field

    Carsten Andrich  [Neil Horman]
        Improve sockopt documentation for packet sockets
    Carsten Andrich  [Willem de Bruijn]

    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: Add some subheadings

connect.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [William Morriss]
        ERRORS: Add EADDRNOTAVAIL for ephemeral port range exhaustion
            Verified from testing and the kernel source.
            See https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=745775
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove mention of ip_local_port_range under EAGAIN error

create_module.2
delete_module.2
init_module.2
query_module.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Lucas De Marchi]
        Clarify glibc header file declaration/ABI wrapper details
            create_module(), delete_module(), init_module(), and
            query_module() are not declared in header files, but
            through an accident of history glibc provides an ABI
            for them that it continues to maintain, for
            compatibility reasons.

execve.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Steven Stewart-Gallus]
        Note SIGKILL case when execve() fails beyond the point of no return
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: Add a subheading and reorder paragraphs

fanotify_init.2
    Heinrich Schuchardt [Michael Kerrisk]
        Document range of permitted flags for event_f_flags
            With a new patch included in the mm tree, event_f_flags is
            checked for allowable values.

fcntl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add "file locking" subheading under NOTES

fork.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: SCHED_DEADLINE tasks can fail with EAGAIN
            SCHED_DEADLINE tasks can fail with EAGAIN unless the
            reset-on-fork flag is set.

futex.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that there is no glibc wrapper

getpriority.2
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototypes for getpriority() and setpriority()
            The who argument has type id_t (which happens to be u32 on linux).

get_robust_list.2
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Add <sys/types.h> to synopsis of get_robust_list()
            If one were to implement wrappers for [gs]et_robust_list() using the
            given prototypes, one would also have to include sys/types.h to get
            a definition of size_t.

getrusage.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Bill Allombert]
        _GNU_SOURCE must be defined to obtain RUSAGE_THREAD definition
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=746569

link.2

    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: Add EADDRINUSE for ephemeral port range exhaustion

mbind.2
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype for mbind(2)
            The nmask argument is const. The return type in numaif.h is long.
            (Well, at least <numaif.h> says nmask is const. The current kernel
            does not define it as a const argument, but sys_mbind() only
            passes it to get_nodes(), which does treat it as const.)

msgop.2
    Davidlohr Bueso [Michael Kerrisk]
        Enhance description of "full queue" criteria

poll.2
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Add <signal.h> to synopsis for ppoll()
            One needs to #include <signal.h> to get the definition of the
            type (sigset_t) of the mask argument to ppoll().

readlink.2
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix return type of readlinkat()

recv.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify details of msg_name and msg_namelen fields

recvmmsg.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe timeout bug
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=75371
            and http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.man/5677

remap_file_pages.2
    Andy Lutomirski [Christoph Hellwig, Andy Lutomirski]
        remap_file_pages() has no benefit for real files
            Linux commit 3ee6dafc677a68e461a7ddafc94a580ebab80735 caused
            remap_file_pages to be emulated when used on real file.

sched_get_priority_max.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        'policy' can also be SCHED_DEADLINE

sched_setaffinity.2
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype for sched_setaffinity()
            The mask argument is const.

sched_setparam.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: mark errors that apply just for sched_setparam()
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: Add EINVAL for invalid arguments
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add sched_setattr(2)

sched_setscheduler.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: mark errors that apply just to sched_setscheduler()
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: add EINVAL case for pid < 0
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: separate out EINVAL cases

semget.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: Add subheadings and reorder paragraphs

semop.2
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototypes for semop() and semtimedop()
            The nsops arguments have type size_t, not unsigned, and the
            timeout argument of semtimedop() is const.
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: Add a subheading

stime.2
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype for stime()
            The argument is const, both according to the actual header files and
            according to <http://www.sco.com/developers/devspecs/vol1a.pdf>.

syscall.2
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype for syscall()
            The first argument and the return value of syscall() has type long,
            not int.

stpcpy.3
    Ingo Schwarze
        Note some history of stpcpy()
            Quoting Ingo:
            I just noticed that the stpcpy(3) manual contains a speculation
            that appears to be untrue on closer investigation:  That function
            did not originate in MS DOS, but in Lattice C on AmigaDOS.

            Here is a patch against the git master HEAD to fix that, and add
            some more historical information.  To provide some background and
            allow you to more easily verify the correctness of the patch, i'm
            appending my mail to <misc@openbsd.org>, where i'm giving some
            more details about the history and pointing to some primary
            sources.  That mail also contains the (similar, but shorter)
            patch i just committed to the OpenBSD manual page.

strcasecmp.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Aurelien Jarno, Török Edwin]
        Explain why strcasecmp()+strncasecmp() are also declared in <string.h>
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=729436

strcpy.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: Add a subheading

fd.4
    Michael Kerrisk  [Sam Varshavchik]
        Fix floppy disk device names
            The naming convention shown in the page was ancient.
            Now, the page is consistent with Documentation/devices.txt
            (where it is noted that "The use of the capital letters
            D, H and E for the 3.5" models have been deprecated, since
            the drive type is insignificant for these devices"

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document /proc/timer_stats
    Michael Kerrisk
        (Briefly) document /proc/timer_list
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add /proc/sys/kernel/{sched_rt_period_us,sched_rt_runtime_us}
            Reference sched(7) for an explanation of these two files

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention sched_setattr(2) under CAP_SYS_NICE

cpuset.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add sched(7)

credentials.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention sched_getattr() as a place where credentials are checked

fanotify.7
    Heinrich Schuchardt  [Jan Kara]
        BUGS: error events can be lost when reading from fanotify FD
    Michael Kerrisk  [Heinrich Schuchardt]
        Fix description of FAN_EVENT_NEXT()
            FAN_EVENT_NEXT() does not update 'meta'; rather, it returns a
            pointer to the next metadata structure. In addition, generally
            rework the description to be a bit clearer and more detailed.
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Document FAN_EVENT_METADATA_LEN

ip.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note cases where an ephemeral port is used
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove BUGS text on glibc failing to declare in_pktinfo
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify 'ip_local_port_range' and mention the term "ephemeral ports"
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note some more details about assignment of ephemeral ports
    Michael Kerrisk
        BUGS: ephemeral port range exhaustion is diagnosed inconsistently
            Different system calls use different 'errno' values to diagnose
            exhaustion of the ephemeral port range.

sched.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document sched_rt_period_us and sched_rt_runtime_us /proc files
            And rework and relocate the text on dealing with runaway
            real-time processes.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention sched_setattr(2) in list of APIs that can change policies
    Michael Kerrisk
        sched_setattr(2) can also be used to set 'nice' value
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove mention of sched_setscheduler() when talking about sched_priority
            There are nowadays multiple ways to set sched_priority (and
            in fact there always were, since we also had sched_setparam(2)).
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: Add Documentation/scheduler/sched-design-CFS.txt
    Michael Kerrisk
        Don't mention sched_setscheduler(2) in discussions of setting policies
            In a couple of places, sched_setscheduler(2) is mentioned as the
            way of setting policies. But now there is sched_setattr(2) as
            well, rewrite the text in a more generic way.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework summary text describing sched_setattr(2) and sched_getattr(2)
            Note that these APIs are a superset of sched_setscheduler(2)
            and sched_getscheduler(2).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty text relating to sched_setscheduler()
            All of the removed text is in sched_setscheduler(2) and
            should have been trimmed from this page.
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: Mention more files in Documentation/scheduler/ directory

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

localedef.1
    Marko Myllynen, Richard Braakman, Alastair McKinstry, Lars Wirzenius
        New page for localedef(1)
            Add new page based on Debian localedef(1) page.


New and changed links
---------------------

procfs.5
    New link to proc.5
        Since the term "procfs" is widely used, it seems reasonable to have
        a link from that name to proc(5).


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

locale.1
    Marko Myllynen
        Provide a step-by-step example of how to use a custom locale
    Marko Myllynen
        Use LC_TELEPHONE instead of LC_MESSAGES in the example
            yesstr/nostr in LC_MESSAGES are planned to be changed at some
            point [1], so it's better to provide an example which won't
            be obsoleted by that change.

            [1] https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16975

adjtimex.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add feature test macro requirements

clone.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: add cross-reference to fork(2) for explanation of EAGAIN

fork.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: add pid_max and threads-max to EAGAIN
            And rewrite text to be the same as pthread_create(3).

getrlimit.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        RLIMIT_NPROC is not enforced if CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RESOURCE

remap_file_pages.2
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            The pgoff argument has type size_t, not ssize_t (and in the
            kernel it is unsigned long).

set_mempolicy.2
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype for set_mempolicy(2)
            The nodemask argument is const. The return type in numaif.h is long.

swapon.2
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Remove header from synopsis
            The <asm/page.h> header is not readily available, and the comment
            seems to indicate that it is for getting PAGE_SIZE. But it is
            never mentioned why one would need to know that, and it is in any
            case better obtained using sysconf(), provided by <unistd.h>.

a64l.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype for a64l()
            The argument is const, both according to POSIX and the
            glibc headers.

adjtime.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Add required header
            The prototype for adjtime(3) is declared in <sys/time.h>.

argz_add.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototypes
            Update the prototypes of argz_{delete,extract,next} to agree with
            glibc headers and manual.

bstring.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototypes
            The length parameter n has type size_t in bcmp(), bcopy() and
            bzero().

envz_add.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototypes
            The envz_len parameters for envz_entry() and envz_get() are not
            passed by reference.

fpathconf.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            The path argument to pathconf() is const.

fseek.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            The pos argument to fsetpos() is const.

gcvt.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            The ndigit parameter to gcvt() has type int.

getaddrinfo_a.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            The pointer arguments to gai_suspend() are const.

getauxval.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix permissions
            There doesn't seem to be any reason for getauxval.3 to be
            executable...

getnameinfo.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            The hostlen and servlen parameters have type socklen_t.
            (The types changed in glibc 2.2)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note types of 'hostlen'; and 'servlen' in glibc < 2.2

getrpcent.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            The argument to getrpcbyname() is const.

getrpcport.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Add #include and fix prototype
            The prototype for getrpcport() is obtained by #include'ing
            <rpc/rpc.h>. Also, update its prototype.

getspnam.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            The struct spwd argument to putspent() is const.

getutent.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototypes
            The arguments to getutid(), getutline(), and pututline()
            are const.

inet.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            The parameters to inet_makeaddr have type in_addr_t.

inet_net_pton.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        srcfix, cfix
            Use a consistent style throughout the man-pages.

key_setsecret.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototypes
            Remove const qualifiers from arguments to key_decryptsession,
            key_encryptsession, and key_setsecret.

makecontext.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            The second argument to swapcontext() is const.

makedev.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            gnu_dev_makedev, and hence its trivial macro wrapper makedev, takes
            two unsigned int parameters; this is consistent with it being the
            inverse of (gnu_dev_)major/minor, which return unsigned int.

malloc_trim.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            As mentioned further down, malloc_trim returns an integer.

mq_getattr.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            The newattr parameter to mq_setattr is const.

newlocale.3
    Marko Myllynen
        List all available category masks
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add LC_ALL_MASK description

nl_langinfo.3
    Marko Myllynen

            Better illustrate querying elements from different categories.

perror.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix declaration
            The elements of the array sys_errlist are also const.

pthread_attr_setaffinity_np.3
pthread_attr_setdetachstate.3
pthread_attr_setguardsize.3
pthread_attr_setinheritsched.3
pthread_attr_setschedparam.3
pthread_attr_setschedpolicy.3
pthread_attr_setscope.3
pthread_attr_setstack.3
pthread_attr_setstackaddr.3
pthread_attr_setstacksize.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Constify parameters
            Each of the pthread_attr_get* functions extract some piece of
            information from a pthread_attr_t, which is passed by const
            reference. Add the const keyword to the prototypes of these
            functions.

pthread_cleanup_push_defer_np.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rasmus Villemoes]
        Add feature test macro requirements

pthread_create.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Carsten Grohmann]
        Add pid_max limit to EAGAIN error cases

pthread_equal.3
    Peng Haitao
        ATTRIBUTES: Note function that is thread-safe
            The function pthread_equal() is thread safe.

pthread_exit.3
    Peng Haitao
        ATTRIBUTES: Note function that is thread-safe
            The function pthread_exit() is thread safe.

pthread_getcpuclockid.3
    Peng Haitao
        ATTRIBUTES: Note function that is thread-safe
            The function pthread_getcpuclockid() is thread safe.

pthread_setaffinity_np.3
    Peng Haitao
        ATTRIBUTES: Note functions that are thread-safe
            The functions pthread_setaffinity_np() and
            pthread_getaffinity_np() are thread safe.

pthread_setconcurrency.3
    Peng Haitao
        ATTRIBUTES: Note functions that are thread-safe
            The functions pthread_setconcurrency() and
            pthread_getconcurrency() are thread safe.

pthread_setname_np.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            The name parameter of pthread_getname_np is an output parameter and
            hence not const.

pthread_setschedparam.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototypes
            Add return type for pthread_{s,g}etschedparam.

pthread_setschedprio.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            Add return type for pthread_setschedprio.

pthread_sigqueue.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Add missing #include <signal.h>

rcmd.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototypes
            Unlike the BSDs, the second argument of rcmd() and rcmd_af() has
            type unsigned short.
            The first argument of iruserok_af() has type const void*.

re_comp.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototypes
            re_comp and re_exec take const char* arguments.

resolver.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototypes and extern-declaration
            Fix const- and signedness of various char* parameters.

            Also, there is no "struct state", but _res is a struct
            __res_state. (Actually, _res is errno-like in that it is really a
            macro expanding to (*__res_state()).)

rexec.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototypes
            The user, passwd and cmd arguments to rexec and rexec_af are all
            const.

rtime.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Replace header
            The header <rpc/des_crypt.h> does not provide rtime();
            <rpc/auth_des.h> does, as is also implied in both the NOTES and
            EXAMPLE sections.

scandir.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototypes
            The alphasort and versionsort functions take arguments of type
            const struct dirent **, not const void *.

setlocale.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Marko Myllynen]
        Simplify locale category listing and add GNU-specific locale categories
            Some information that was here will move to locale(7).
    Marko Myllynen
        Remove now obsolete NOTES section

setnetgrent.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            The buflen argument to getnetgrent_r has type size_t.

sigvec.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            The vec argument to sigvec is const.

tsearch.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            The rootp argument to tfind is "void * const *",
            not "const void **".

core.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Core dump files are nowadays core.pid by default

locale.5
    Marko Myllynen
        Document mon_grouping and grouping properly
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note default value for 'first_workday'
    Michael Kerrisk  [Marko Myllynen]
        Add brief descriptions of collating-element and collating-symbol
    Marko Myllynen
        t_fmt_ampm is needed only for locales that employ AM/PM convention
    Michael Kerrisk  [Marko Myllynen]
        Remove crufty reference to /usr/lib/nls/src
            That file is nowhere to be found
    Marko Myllynen
        Clarify LC_TIME/am_pm and LC_NAME keywords usage
            am_pm should be defined only if AM/PM convention is used to signal
            applications they should not try to print them when using them in
            unwanted.

            Same for all LC_NAME keywords expect for name_fmt which should be
            always defined.
    Marko Myllynen
        Clarify lang_term / lang_lib
            As noted by Keld Simonsen in the lib-locales@sourceware mailing
            list:

                https://sourceware.org/ml/libc-locales/2014-q2/msg00008.html
                From: Keld Simonsen <keld at rap dot rap dot dk>
                To: Marko Myllynen <myllynen at redhat dot com>
                Date: Tue, 29 Apr 2014 17:02:09 +0200

                lang_term reflects ISO 639-2/T (terminology) codes, while
                lang_lib reflects ISO 639-2/B (bibliographic) codes.
                lang_term is preferred over lang_lib codes for locale names.
                There are 20 specific ISO 639-2/B codes.
    Marko Myllynen
        Correct the FILES section

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        'pid_max' is a system-wide limit on number of threads and processes
            Since PIDs > /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max are not allocated, this
            file thus also imposes a system-wide limit on the number of
            threads and processes.

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        CAP_SYS_ADMIN allows overriding RLIMIT_NPROC
    Michael Kerrisk
        CAP_SYS_PTRACE allows process_vm_readv(2) and process_vm_writev(2)

charsets.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Marko Myllynen]
        Remove crufty statement that Romanian may be switching to ISO 8859-16
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove ancient paragraph on charsets supported in glibc 2.3.2
            That test is rather ancient, and probably of little use.

fanotify.7
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Fix to example program: fanotify read() should use aligned buffer

inotify.7
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Add example program
            This example of the usage of the inotify API shows the
            usage of inotify_init1(2) and inotify_add_watch(2) as well
            as polling and reading from the inotify file descriptor.
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        munmap() does not generate inotify events

locale.7
    Marko Myllynen [Michael Kerrisk]
        Document the LOCPATH environment variable
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add further details on various categories

    Marko Myllynen
        Clarify AM/PM settings a bit
            localedef(1) complains if really undefined, should be empty instead.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

iconv.1
iconvconfig.8
    Marko Myllynen
        Clarify gconv file terminology a bit

ldd.1
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add sprof(1)

connect.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: add EPROTOTYPE
            See https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=708394

dup.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rich Felker]
        Fix erroneous discussion regarding closing 'newfd' before calling dup2()
            And propose a workaround if the caller cares about catching
            close() time errors.

            See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23440216/race-condition-when-using-dup2#comment36888604_23444465
            and http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=411
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework and enhance discussion of dup2()
            In particular, note that dup2() performs the steps of closing
            and reusing 'newfd' atomically.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add subhead for dup3()

epoll_ctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        BUGS: EPOLLWAKEUP is silently ignored without CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND
            If the caller does not have CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND, then EPOLLWAKEUP
            is silently ignored.

fcntl.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Tomi Salminen]
        The return value for F_SETPIPE_SZ is the pipe capacity
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: Document ENOTDIR error for F_NOTIFY

    Michael Kerrisk
        Suggest the use of real-time signals with F_NOTIFY

getitimer.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite a few pieces to clarify some details

inotify_add_watch.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that the target of a watch is an i-node
            The target of a watch is an i-node, not a pathname. Clarify
            the text to prevent the reader possibly misunderstanding
            that establishing watches by two different links to the same
            file might create different watch descriptors.

open.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Кирилл]
        O_CLOEXEC is also one the flags not ignored when O_PATH is specified

pipe.2
    Elie De Brauwer
        PIPE_BUF is defined in limits.h
            To make use of PIPE_BUF in an application one should include
            <limits.h>.  Adding a reference to this inclusion.

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Nadav Har'El]
        The negate-fd-to-ignore technique does not work for file descriptor 0
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=79411

set_tid_address.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rich Felker]
        Use "thread" rather than "process" in DESCRIPTION
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add gettid(2)

shmop.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain SHMLBA in much more detail

splice.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document EAGAIN error
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=48641

syscalls.2
    Carlos O'Donell
        Add prlimit64(2)
            While trying to reconcile the new features in glibc with the
            documented entries in the linux kernel man pages I noticed that
            glibc exports prlimit64 for use by 32-bit applications (as does
            the linux kernel), but that prlimit64 was not defined in the
            syscalls list or in the prlimit-related page.

            This is not the complete fix for this, but I don't have the time
            to explain why and when prlimit64 should be used (or how it should
            be used safely). Therefore I'm just patching the syscalls.2 list
            to show that prlimit64 exists and was added in 2.6.36 (verified
            with git by checking out the tags before and after).

syslog.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework introductory paragraph
    Michael Kerrisk  [Robert P. J. Day]
        Rework text describing loglevels
            The kernel header file mentioned in the discussion of the KERN_*
            constants has morphed and is no longer exported inside glibc.
            And the definitions of the constants themselves changed subtly
            with kernel commit 04d2c8c83d0e3ac5f78aeede51babb3236200112.
            So, rewrite the description of the constants to be a bit more
            abstract.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite parts of the page, and import /proc/sys/kernel/printk
            * Move /proc/sys/kernel/printk from proc(5) to this page,
              and correct various details in the discussion of that file.
            * Rewrite and correct various other details on the page.
            * Clean out some crufty text.
            * Miscellaneous minor fixes.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update SYSLOG_ACTION_CONSOLE_OFF + SYSLOG_ACTION_CONSOLE_ON description
            Details changed in Linux 2.6.32

tee.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document EAGAIN error
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=48641

vmsplice.2

ether_aton.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make description of ether_line() bug a little more informative

mallopt.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Florian Weimer]
        MALLOC_MMAP_THRESHOLD_ and MALLOC_MMAP_MAX_ *do* work in setgid programs
            My testing on this point was bogus, overlooking details of
            strace(1)'s behavior with setuid programs.

            See https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12155

printf.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rich Felker]
        Remove libc4 and libc5 details
            Rich Felker noted that "scare text" in the man page warned about
            the use of snprintf() on libc, and that some people had cited
            this as a reason not to use snprintf().  Linux libc is now
            ancient history, so there is no real need to keep that text.
            But, while we're at it, we may as well clear out all of the
            other ancient libc4 and libc5 pieces in the page. They are
            nowadays more clutter than help.
    Michael Kerrisk
        SUSv3 and later agree with C99 for the snprintf() return value
            Determined by inspection of the SUSv3 and SUSv4 specifications.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove some old text about glibc 2.0 changes
            We probably don't now need such ancient info.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update references to standards for C and S conversion specifiers

charmap.5
    Marko Myllynen
        Various minor updates and improvements
            - more precise title
            - extend description a bit
            - document previously omitted WIDTH_DEFAULT
    Marko Myllynen
        Remove accidental ISO C compliance reference
            glibc refers in locale/programs/charmap.c to ISO C 99 section
            7.17.(2) and ISO C 99 section 5.2.1.(3) that if a character map
            is not ASCII compatible then the locale using it is not ISO C
            compliant. This does not state anything about the character set
            itself.

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Replace /proc/sys/kernel/printk discussion with reference to syslog(2)
            It makes more sense to have the /proc/sys/kernel/printk with
            the related material in syslog(2).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite /proc/sys/kernel/printk description

inotify.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify which events are generated for watched directories
            Really, with respect to watched directories, events fall into
            three classes (not two, as was shown):

            * Events that can be generated only for the watched directory.
            * Events that can be generated only for objects that are inside
              the watched directory.
            * Events that can be generated both for the watched directory
              and for objects inside the directory.

            So, mark these three classes more clearly in the list of inotify
            events.
    Heinrich Schuchardt  [Michael Kerrisk]
        BUGS: Note possible bug triggered by watch descriptor reuse
            Watch descriptor IDs are returned by inotify_add_watch().
            When calling inotify_rm_watch() an IN_IGNORED is placed on the
            inotify queue pointing to the ID of the removed watch.

            inotify_add_watch() should not return a watch descriptor ID for
            which events are still on the queue but should return an
            unused ID.

            Unfortunately, the existing Kernel code does not provide such a
            guarantee.

            Actually, in rare cases watch descriptor IDs are returned by
            inotify_add_watch() for which events are still on the inotify
            queue.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=77111
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add further detail to the watch descriptor reuse bug
            As well as inotify_rm_watch(), file deletion and unmounting a
            filesystem can also cause a watch descriptor to be deleted.
    Michael Kerrisk
        The watch descriptor reuse bug may be hard to hit in practice
            Explain the circumstances in detail, indicating that the
            bug may be very unlikely to occur in practice.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify description of IN_EXCL_UNLINK
            Clarify the text a little, in particular making it clearer
            that the target of a watch is an i-node (not a pathname).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify IN_ONESHOT explanation
            Make it clearer that the target of monitoring is an i-node,
            not a pathname.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make comment on 'mask' field more accurate

libc.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify man-pages policy on documenting C libraries other than glibc
    Michael Kerrisk
        Use absolute dates in discussion of libc vs glibc

pipe.7
    Elie De Brauwer
        Add reference that the pipe capacity can be changed
            In fcntl(2) F_SETPIPE_SZ, F_GETPIPE_SZ and
            /proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size are defined, however
            pipe(7) still defines the pipe capacity as being
            a static entity. Adding a reference to fcntl(2).
    Michael Kerrisk  [Walter Harms]
        Clarify that since 2.6.35, 65535 bytes is the default pipe capacity

ld.so.8
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that LD_PROFILE can specify just a single shared object
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that LD_PROFILE output is appended to target file
            The LD_PROFILE output is appended to any existing
            contents of the target file.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

access.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Glibc falls back to using access() on kernels that lack faccessat()

bdflush.2
fsync.2
sync.2
proc.5
    Adrian Bunk
        Change "sync(1)" to "sync(8)"

bind.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Ryan Hammonds]
        Correct EINVAL error description
            As pointed out by Ryan:

                My application is trying to bind an IPv4 UDP socket to an
                address. I've found that passing an invalid address length
                to bind() causes bind to return EINVAL. According to the
                bind(2) manpage, this should only occur when using unix
                domain sockets (which I am not).

chmod.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Glibc falls back to chmod() on kernels that don't support fchmodat()
    Michael Kerrisk
        Glibc falls back to chown()/lchown() on kernels that lack fchownat()

epoll_wait.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: describe raw epoll_pwait() system call differences

getgroups.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add group_member(3)

getpriority.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Enhance discussion of kernel nice range versus user-space nice range
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move text describing nice range on other systems

getrlimit.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add cross reference to core(5) in discussion of RLIMIT_CORE
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe the "large" resource limit bug on 32-bit platforms
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5042.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Glibc's setrlimit() and getrlimit() are implemented using prlimit()

kexec_load.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note limit of 16 for 'nr_segments'
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify the 'flags' bits that contain the architecture
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add KEXEC_ARCH_68K to list of architectures for 'flags'
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reword description of 'flags' a little

link.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Glibc falls back to link() on kernels that lack linkat()
            Unless 'flags' contains AT_SYMLINK_FOLLOW.

mkdir.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Glibc falls back to mkdir() on kernels that don't support mkdirat()

perf_event_open.2
    Vince Weaver
        Clarify PERF_SAMPLE_STACK_USER usage
            This clarifies the PERF_SAMPLE_STACK_USER section.
            I found these issue while implementing some code that uses
            the option.  The important change is fixing the name of the
            sample_stack_user parameter, the rest is just some wording
            fixes and minor clarifications.
    Vince Weaver
        Clarify PERF_SAMPLE_DATA_SRC usage
            When checking the fields in the PERF_SAMPLE_DATA_SRC type samples
            you need to shift the masks before doing the compare.

            Although the value you are checking (perf_mem_data_src) is
            specified as a bitfield so this might all fall apart if trying
            to access the field in a cross-endian way.  The Power people
            were working on this issue, not sure if they resolved it.

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe fifth argument (sigsetsize) of raw ppoll() system call

process_vm_readv.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Ville Ylenius]
        Fix typo in example program

    Michael Kerrisk
        Glibc falls back to readlink() on kernels that lack readlinkat()

recv.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        'addrlen' should be NULL (not 0) if we don't need sender address

rename.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Glibc falls back to rename() when the kernel doesn't have renameat()

sigwaitinfo.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        The raw sigtimedwait() system call has a fifth argument

symlink.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Glibc falls back to symlink() on kernels that lack symlinkat()

sysinfo.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add VERSIONS section

unlink.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Glibc falls back to unlink() or rmdir() on kernels that lack unlinkat()

atoi.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Downgrade discussion of atoq()
            Remove most references to atoq() in this page, since this function
            was present only in Linux libc (not glibc).

setbuf.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove ancient Linux libc and 4.x BSD details

strstr.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove discussion of Linux libc bugs
            Linux libc is old enough that we needn't care any longer.

strtod.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain NAN(n-char-sequence)

strtod.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add nan(3), nanf(3), NANL(3)

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

connect.2
    Michael Haardt
        Note that a new socket should be used if connect() fails

fcntl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        One must define _GNU_SOURCE to get the F_OFD_* definitions

poll.2, select.2
    Rusty Russell
        Fix erroneous description of "available for write".
            POSIX says: "POLLOUT Normal data may be written without
            blocking.".  This "may" is misleading, see the POSIX
            write page:

                Write requests to a pipe or FIFO shall be handled in the
                same way as a regular file with the following exceptions:
                ...
                If the O_NONBLOCK flag is clear, a write request may cause
                the thread to block, but on normal completion it shall
                return nbyte.
                ...
                When attempting to write to a file descriptor (other than a
                pipe or FIFO) that supports non-blocking writes and cannot
                accept the data immediately:

                If the O_NONBLOCK flag is clear, write() shall block the
                calling thread until the data can be accepted.

                If the O_NONBLOCK flag is set, write() shall not block the
                thread. If some data can be written without blocking the
                thread, write() shall write what it can and return the
                number of bytes written. Otherwise, it shall return -1 and
                set errno to [EAGAIN].

            The net result is that write() of more than 1 byte on a
            socket, pipe or FIFO which is "ready" may block: write()
            (unlike read!) will attempt to write the entire buffer and
            only return a short write under exceptional circumstances.

            Indeed, this is the behaviour we see in Linux:

errno.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add errno(1)

rtnetlink.3
    Holger Hans Peter Freyther
        Fix parameters for the send() call in the example

inotify.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        IN_OPEN and IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE can also occur for directories
    Michael Kerrisk
        IN_CLOSE_WRITE occurs only for files (not monitored directory)
    Michael Kerrisk
        IN_MODIFY is generated for files only (not monitored directories)

        IN_ACCESS occurs only for files inside directories
            IN_ACCESS does not occur for monitored directory.

packet.7
    Sorin Dumitru
        Fix include file
            It looks like most of the socket options from this man pages
            are not defined in <netpacket/packet.h>. They are defined in
            <linux/if_packet.h> so we should include that one.

                      Serge Hallyn]
        New page describing PID namespaces

user_namespaces.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Eric W. Biederman, Andy Lutomirski, Serge Hallyn]

    Michael Kerrisk
        Move some CLONE_NEWUTS text 2 to namespaces.7

flock.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [J. Bruce Fields]
        Don't mention "classical BSD" in discussion of fcntl()/flock interaction
            The noninteraction of flock(2) and fcntl(2) locks does
            not seem to be classical BSD semantics (at least, checking
            the 4.4BSD sources suggest that the lock types do interact,
            although there have been other systems also where fcntl()
            and flock() locks do not interact). So, fix the text
            discussing "classical BSD" lock semantics.

            s/size of unwind table/size of the unwind data/

        Clarify capabilities required for reassociating with a mount namespace
    Michael Kerrisk

            And remove text on flags from VERSIONS.

unshare.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add an example program
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify semantics of CLONE_SYSVSEM
    Michael Kerrisk
        CLONE_SYSVSEM does not require CAP_SYS_ADMIN
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note flags implied by CLONE_THREAD and CLONE_VM

clock.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Vincent Lefevre]
        The implementation uses clock_gettime() was to improve *accuracy*
            (The man page text mistakenly used the word "precision".)

drand48.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Lorenzo Beretta]

        Move /proc/[pid]/mountstats text to namespaces.7

        Refer reader to user_namespaces(7) for a discussion of capabilities
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document CAP_SETUID and CAP_SETGID for user namespace mappings
    Michael Kerrisk
        setns() needs CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the *target* namespace
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since Linux 3.8, user namespaces no longer require CAP_SYS_ADMIN

mq_overview.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer to namespaces(7) for info on POSIX MQs and IPC namespaces

svipc.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer to namespaces(7) for info on System V IPC and IPC namespaces

        Charset pages unification, minor cleanups
            This and [the related *.7] patches will provide unification of
            charset pages, minor cleanups, and some unifying cosmetic
            changes. References are adjusted so that all pages include
            a reference to charsets(7), which contains a description of
            these sets, stray comments are removed, some obsolete
            statements (like ISO 8859-1 being the de-facto ASCII
            replacement) are removed, and some minor reformatting
            to minimize diff's between the pages are done.

            The actual substance, the character tables, remain unchanged.

            This series changes the following pages (under man7): ascii,
            armscii, cp1251, koi8-r, koi8-u, and all of iso_8859-*.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

localedef.1
    Marko Myllynen
        Mention default path for compiled files

clock_nanosleep.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that 'clock_id' can also be a CPU clock ID

epoll_ctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Regular files and directories can't be monitored with epoll_ctl()

ioctl.2
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Rename 'd' argument to 'fd' in text
            In most other manpages file descriptors are called 'fd'.
            This patches renames attribute 'd' to 'fd'.

madvise.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        VERSIONS: Support for madvise() is now configurable
            Support for this system call now depends on the
            CONFIG_ADVISE_SYSCALLS configuration option.

open.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Enhance rationale discussion for openat() and friends

posix_fadvise.2
    Mel Gorman
        Document the behavior of partial page discard requests
            It is not obvious from the interface that "partial page discard"
            requests are ignored. It should be spelled out.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Weijie Yang]
        ERRORS: Since 2.6.16, the kernel correctly deals with the ESPIPE case
    Michael Kerrisk
        Support for fadvise64() is now configurable
            Support for this system call now depends on the
            CONFIG_ADVISE_SYSCALLS configuration option.

prctl.2
    Andreas Schwab
        Correct description of null-termination in PR_GET_NAME and PR_SET_NAME
            The size of the process name has always been at most 16 byte
            _including_ the null terminator.  This also means that the
            name returned by PR_GET_NAME is always null-terminated.
    Michael Kerrisk
        PR_SET_NAME silently truncates strings that exceed 16 bytes

restart_syscall.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some text explaining why restart_syscall() exists

sched_setaffinity.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: Add paragraph on how to discover set of CPUs available on system
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add nproc(1) and lscpu(1)

select.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add restart_syscall(2)

semop.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add note that interrupted semtimedop() returns 'timeout' unchanged
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove information about semtimedop() EAGAIN that is repeated elsewhere
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add subsection head for semtimedop()

setsid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite some pieces and add some details
            Among other changes, add an explanation of why setsid() can't
            be called from a process group leader

sgetmask.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since 3.16, support for these system calls is configurable
            Support for these calls is now dependent on the setting of the
            CONFIG_SGETMASK_SYSCALL option.

sigaction.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document SA_RESTORER
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some detail on the sa_restorer field
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add sigreturn(2)

splice.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reformat description of 'fd_in' and 'off_in' to improve readability

syscall.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add errno(3)

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add errno(3)
    Michael Kerrisk
        3.19 adds execveat()
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add bpf(2) to list

tee.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add shell session demonstrating use of the example program

tkill.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rich Felker]
        Remove bogus text saying tgid==-1 makes tgkill() equivalent to tkill()

abort.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that SIGABRT is raised as though raise(3) is called
            Also note that abort() is POSIX.1-2008 compliant.

cmsg.3
    David Wragg
        Ensure buf is suitably aligned in sending example
            Inspection of the definition of CMSG_FIRSTHDR (both in glibc and
            the suggested definition in RFC3542) shows that it yields the
            msg_control field.  So when sending, the pointer placed in
            msg_control should be suitably aligned as a struct cmsghdr.
            In the sending example, buf was declared as a bare char array,
            and so is not necessarily suitably aligned.

            The solution here involves placing buf inside a union, and is
            based on the sockets/scm_rights_send.c sample from The Linux
            Programming Interface "dist" source code collection.

exp10.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Before glibc 2.19, exp() did not give ERANGE error on underflow
            http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6787

ftw.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        FTW_CHDIR has no effect on the 'fpath' argument passed to fn()

getopt.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jonny Grant]
        Ensure that 'nsecs' is used

ilogb.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Will Newton]
        Since glibc 2.16, ilogb() does correctly diagnose domain errors

memcmp.3
    Michael Haardt
        Document return value for n==0 case
    Michael Haardt
        Warn against use of memcmp() for comparing security-critical data

mq_open.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document the O_CLOEXEC flag
    Michael Kerrisk
        Place 'flags' constants in alphabetical order

pow.3
    Manuel López-Ibáñez
        Add note on performance characteristics of pow()

pthread_setschedparam.3
    Simon Newton
        Fix logic error in example program
            The example program will crash if -A is used, since 'attr'
            is uninitialized.

                $ ./a.out  -A
                *** Error in `./a.out': free(): invalid pointer: 0xb779c3c4 ***
                Aborted (core dumped)
    刘湃
        Small fixes to example program

sigvec.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Starting with version 2.21, glibc no longer exports sigvec()

sysconf.3
    Josh Triplett
        Document _SC_NGROUPS_MAX
            Already documented in getgroups(2), but not in sysconf(3).

termios.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add tset(1)

tgamma.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since glibc 2.18, errno is correctly set to EDOM when (x == -infinity))

wordexp.3
    Carlos O'Donell
        Make it clear that WRDE_NOCMD prevents command substitution
            The use of WRDE_NOCMD prevents command substitution. If the flag
            WRDE_NOCMD is set then no command substitution shall occur and
            the error WRDE_CMDSUB will be returned if such substitution is
            requested when processing the words.

            The manual page as-is makes it seem like the command substitution
            occurs, and an error is returned *after* the substitution.
            This patch clarifies that.

locale.5
    Marko Myllynen
        Describe the formats of values
            locale(5) describes what a locale should define but doesn't
            spell out how (in what format). The patch attempts to address
            this, it also has few trivial additional enhancements.

            * Reference to locale(7) for category descriptions.
            * Clarify first_workday in NOTES a bit.
            * Add upstream BZ reference for two missing LC_ADDRESS fields.
    Marko Myllynen
        Fix miscoded character

resolv.conf.5
    Jan Chaloupka
        Add missing no-tld-query option
            Based on commit [1], the no-tld-query option exists for
            resolv.conf configuration file.  Description of this option
            is provided in [2]. This patch just copies this option
            into resolv.conf.5 man page. Plus changes 'a' member
            into 'an' before 'unqualified name as if it ...'
            on the third line of [2]. Based on [3], this option
            was added in glibc 2.14 as solving [4] bug.

            [4] https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12734

credentials.7
    Josh Triplett
        Cross-reference getgroups(2)
            Since credentials.7 discusses supplementary GIDs, it should
            reference getgroups(2).

fanotify.7
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Allow relative paths in example
            The current example code requires passing an absolute
            path to the mount to be watched.

            By passing AT_FDCWD to fanotify_mark it can use both
            absolute and relative paths.
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        fallocate(2) creates no events
            fallocate(2) should create FAN_MODIFY events but does not.
    Heinrich Schuchardt [Michael Kerrisk]
        fanotify notifies only events generated on the same mount
            Unfortunately, fanotify does not inform listeners for all paths
            under which a touched filesystem object is visible, but only the
            listener using the same path as the process touching the
            filesystem object.
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Update BUGS to note bugs still not fixed in 3.17
            I bumped the Linux version number in the BUGS section to 3.17.

inotify.7
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        fallocate(2) does not trigger inotify events
            Calling fallocate(2) does not result in inotify events.

locale.7
    Marko Myllynen
        Improve LOCPATH description
            LOCPATH is ignored by privileged programs.

            Add locale archive references.

            Add FILES section.

man-pages.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Laurent Georget]
        Clarify that SEE ALSO entries may refer to pages from other projects

signal.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention other "slow devices"
            Reads from eventfd(2), signalfd(2), timerfd(2), inotify(7),
            and fanotify(7) file descriptors are also slow operations
            that are restartable.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix SO_RECVTIMEO/ SO_SENDTIMEO confusion in text
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since Linux 3.8, reads on inotify(7) file descriptors are restartable
    Michael Kerrisk
        inotify(7) reads no longer show the odd EINTR error after SIGCONT
            Since kernel 3.7, reads from inotify(7) file descriptors no longer
            show the (Linux oddity) behavior of failing with EINTR when the
            process resumes after a stop signal + SIGCONT.
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add sigreturn(2)

unix.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Scott Harvey]
        Fix buglet in code snippet in BUGS section

ld.so.8
    Carlos O'Donell
        Add --inhibit-cache option
            The dynamic loader has 6 options, only 5 are documented.
            This patch documents the sixth option i.e. `--inhibit-cache`.
    Jonathan Wakely  [Siddhesh Poyarekar]
        Correct documentation of $ORIGIN
            As noted by Siddhesh:

                The ld.so man page says:

                    $ORIGIN (or equivalently ${ORIGIN})
                        This expands to the directory containing the
                        application executable.  Thus, an application located
                        in somedir/app could be compiled with

                This is incorrect since it expands to the directory containing
                the DSO and not the application executable.  This seems like
                deliberate behaviour in dl-object.c, so it needs to be fixed in
                the man page.

            See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26280738/what-is-the-equivalent-of-loader-path-for-rpath-specification-on-linux/26281226#26281226

Apologies if I missed anyone!


New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

seccomp.2
    Kees Cook, Michael Kerrisk, Will Drewry  [Andy Lutomirski]
        New page documenting seccomp(2)
            Combines documentation from prctl, in-kernel seccomp_filter.txt
            and dropper.c, along with details specific to the new system call.


Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

netlink.7
    Stephan Mueller  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Add NETLINK_CRYPTO


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

adjtimex.2
    Laurent Georget  [Richard Cochran, Jeff Epler]
        Clarify the 'ppm scaling' used in struct timex
            This patch makes explicit and clarifies the unit used for
            the fields "freq", "ppsfreq" and "stabil" in struct timex.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Masanari Iida]
        Note that TIME_ERROR is the modern synonym for TIME_BAD

perf_event_open.2
    Vince Weaver
        Clarify the PERF_FLAG_FD_* flags
            This change clarifies the behavior of the PERF_FLAG_FD_OUTPUT and
            PERF_FLAG_FD_NO_GROUP flags to perf_event_open(), and removes
            the related FIXME comments.

            While writing tests to validate the behavior of these flags I
            discovered that PERF_FLAG_FD_OUTPUT has been broken since the
            2.6.35 kernel release.

prctl.2
    Dave Hansen [Michael Kerrisk]
        Add description of Intel MPX calls
            The 3.19 kernel will have support for Intel MPX, including
            a pair of new prctl() calls (PR_MPX_ENABLE_MANAGEMENT and
            PR_MPX_DISABLE_MANAGEMENT) for enabling and disabling the
            kernel's management of the "bounds tables".  Add a
            descriptions of the interface.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add mention of seccomp(2) under PR_SET_SECCOMP
    Michael Kerrisk
        Suggest /proc/PID/status "Seccomp" as alternative to PR_GET_SECCOMP
    Michael Kerrisk
        SIGKILL can also occur PR_GET_SECCOMP in SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER mode
    Kees Cook  [Andy Lutomirski]
        Document SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER vs EFAULT
            This notes the distinction made between EINVAL and EFAULT when
            attempting to use SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER with PR_SET_SECCOMP.

setns.2
pid_namespaces.7
    Mike Frysinger
        Elaborate discussion of the PID namespace descendant limitation
            The setns(2) man page already mentions that CLONE_NEWPID may only
            be used with descendant namespaces, but this nuance could be
            listed in a few more places so it is not missed.

shmget.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Akihiro Motoki]
        Make wording of SHMALL description a little clearer

sigaction.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add siginfo_t fields for SECCOMP_RET_TRAP

memchr.3
strstr.3
    Alexandre Bique
        Reference memmem(3) in SEE ALSO section

memcmp.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Michael Haardt]
        NOTES: add some detail on avoiding memcmp() of cryptographic data
            Wording largely based on comments from Michael Haardt.

pthread_tryjoin_np.3
    Jérôme Pouiller  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Document EINVAL error for pthread_timedjoin_np()

mem.4
    Elie De Brauwer
        /dev/kmem depends on CONFIG_DEVKMEM
    Elie De Brauwer
        Correct /dev/port group in example
            mem.4 mentions that group for /dev/port should be set to 'mem'
            However, all other files (/dev/mem and /dev/kmem) use the kmem
            group in their examples and on my system /dev/port belongs to
            kmem. Hence the 'mem' group was probably a typo:
    Elie De Brauwer
        Add CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM
            Since 2.6.26 the CONFIG_NONPROMISC_DEVMEM options limits the
            physical addresses which can be accessed through /dev/mem.

random.4
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Describe handling of O_NONBLOCK
            /dev/random and /dev/urandom treat O_NONBLOCK differently.
            This should be described in the manpage.
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Mention PRNG used by urandom
            /dev/urandom uses a pseudo-random number generator to replace
            missing entropy.

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document "Seccomp" field of /proc/PID/status

epoll.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Ignat Loskutov]
        Use epoll_create1() rather than epoll_create() in the code example
            epoll_create1() is more or less the preferred API for new
            applications, since it allows for some flags and avoids the
            misdesigned epoll_create() argument, and so it seems sensible
            to use that in the example, rather than epoll_create().

tcp.7
    Troy Davis
        Clarify tcp_tw_recycle on Internet-facing hosts
            Clarify that tcp_tw_recycle will break communication with many
            general-purpose remote Internet hosts (namely, remote NAT devices)
            even when the Linux device itself is not behind NAT.

        Add execveat(2) in system call list under "Rationale for openat()"

perf_event_open.2
    Vince Weaver
        Clarify description of overflow events
            Update the perf_event_open manpage to be more consistent when
            discussing overflow events.  It merges the discussion of
            poll-type notifications with those generated by SIGIO
            signal handlers.
            This addresses the remaining FIXMEs is the document.
    Vince Weaver
        Remove inaccurate paragraph describing attr.config
            Remove an inaccurate paragraph about values in the attr.config
            field.  This information was never true in any released kernel;
            it somehow snuck into the manpage because it is still described
            this way in tools/perf/design.txt in the kernel source tree.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Correct the kernel version number for PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_NODE
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some kernel version numbers to various fields and constants

ptrace.2
sigaction.2
seccomp.2
    Kees Cook
        Ptrace and siginfo details
            While writing some additional seccomp tests, I realized
            PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP wasn't documented yet. Fixed this, and added
            additional notes related to ptrace events SIGTRAP details.

readv.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update details on glibc readv()/writev() wrapper behavior
            And add a historical detail about Linux 2.0.

select.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention RLIMIT_NOFILE as a possible cause of EINVAL error

syscall.2
    Kees Cook
        Add arm64 and mips
            Add mips and arm64 to tables, along with some further
            details on these architectures,

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add s390_pci_mmio_read(2) and s390_pci_mmio_write(2)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note kernel() version that introduced get_kernel_syms()
        Note kernel version that introduced ppc_rtas()
        Note kernel version that introduced create_module()
        Note kernel version that added setup()
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove some details for sync_file_range2()
            Make the table a bit simpler. The details can anyway be
            found in the system call man page.

utimensat.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Elliot Hughes]
        If both tv_sec fields are UTIME_OMIT, the file need not exist
            As noted by Elliot, if both tv_sec fields are UTIME_OMIT,
            utimensat() will return success even if the file does not exist.

errno.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        The RLIMIT_NOFILE resource limit is a common cause of EMFILE

exec.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add execveat(2)

fclose.3
    Carlos O'Donell
        Consistency fix: use "stream" as name for "FILE *" argument
            Harmonize all the manual pages to use "stream" for FILE*
            instead of randomly using "fp" or "stream." Choosing something
            and being consistent helps users scan the man pages quickly
            and understand what they are looking at.

fexecve.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite the script+close-on-exec problem as a BUG
            Also, add one or two details about this scenario.
    Michael Kerrisk
        The natural idiom when using fexecve() is to use the close-on-exec flag

fmemopen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Consistency fix: use "stream" as name for "FILE *" argument

fopencookie.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Consistency fix: use "stream" as name for "FILE *" argument

getpwent_r.3
    Carlos O'Donell
        Consistency fix: use "stream" as name for "FILE *" argument

getspnam.3
    Carlos O'Donell
        Consistency fix: use "stream" as name for "FILE *" argument

malloc_info.3
    Carlos O'Donell
        Consistency fix: use "stream" as name for "FILE *" argument

posix_fallocate.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that posix_fallocate() is implemented using fallocate(2)

putgrent.3
    Carlos O'Donell
        Consistency fix: use "stream" as name for "FILE *" argument
            Harmonize all the manual pages to use "stream" for FILE*
            instead of randomly using "fp" or "stream." Choosing something
            and being consistent helps users scan the man pages quickly
            and understand what they are looking at.

locale.5
    Akihiro Motoki
        Correct variable name

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove bogus statement about NR_OPEN being a ceiling for file-max

fflush.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Sergey V. Zubkov]
        Clarify that flushing of input streams occurs only for seekable files
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91931
    Michael Kerrisk  [Sergey V. Zubkov]
        POSIX.1-2008 specifies the behavior when flushing input streams
            POSIX.1-2001 did not have a specification for input streams,
            but POSIX.1-2008 added one.

getopt.3

        SEE ALSO: add getopt(1)

random.3

        SEE ALSO: add getrandom(2)

termios.3

        SEE ALSO: add reset(1), setterm(1), tput(1)

tzset.3
    J William Piggott
        Document behavior when TZ filespec omits the colon
            If the TZ filespec omits the leading colon, glibc will parse
            it for any valid format, i.e., it will still work.
    J William Piggott
        Add description for posixrules file
    J William Piggott
        Correct system timezone file path
    J William Piggott
        There are only two TZ formats
            tzset(3) currently states that there are three TZ formats. The
            first two it lists are actually variations of the POSIX-style
            TZ format, of which there are at least five variations.

            This patch corrects this to match the POSIX specification of
            TZ having only two formats.
    J William Piggott
        Filespec omitted incorrect
            Paragraph three of the DESCRIPTION section says
            that when TZ is set, but empty, then UTC is used.

            Later it says if the TZ filespec is omitted then the file
            /usr/share/zoneinfo/localtime is used.  This is incorrect,
            it will use UTC in that case as well.
    J William Piggott
        Fix incorrect TZ string representation
            The TZ string representation indicates that the start/end
            rules are required; this is incorrect.
    J William Piggott
        Add ENVIRONMENT section + other rearrangements
            FILES section was overly verbose and included
            environment variables.  Added ENVIRONMENT section,
            removing ENV VARS from the FILES section.

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

ioctl_fat.2
    Heinrich Schuchardt  [Michael Kerrisk]
        New man page for the ioctl(2) FAT API
            The ioctl(2) system call may be used to retrieve information about
            the FAT file system and to set file attributes.

madvise.2
    Michael Kerrisk
         Summary: this page has been significantly reorganised and rewritten
    Michael Kerrisk
        Recast discussion of 'advice' into two groups of values
            madvise() is one of those system calls that has congealed over
            time, as has the man page. It's helpful to split the discussion
            of 'advice' into those flags into two groups:

            * Those flags that are (1) widespread across implementations;
              (2) have counterparts in posix_madvise(3); and (3) were present
              in the initial Linux madvise implementation.
            * The rest, which are values that (1) may not have counterparts
              in other implementations; (2) have no counterparts in
              posix_madvise(3); and (3) were added to Linux in more recent
              times.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explicitly list the five flags provided by posix_fadvise()
            Over time, bit rot has afflicted this page. Since the original
            text was written many new Linux-specific flags have been added.
            So, now it's better to explicitly list the flags that
            correspond to the POSIX analog of madvise().
    Jan Chaloupka  [Hugh Dickins, Michael Kerrisk]
        Starting with Linux 3.5, more file systems support MADV_REMOVE
    Michael Kerrisk
        Split EINVAL error into separate cases
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain MADV_REMOVE in terms of file hole punching
    Michael Kerrisk
        MADV_REMOVE can be applied only to shared writable mappings
    Michael Kerrisk
        MADV_REMOVE cannot be applied to locked or Huge TLB pages
    Michael Kerrisk  [Vlastimil Babka]
        Clarify that MADV_DONTNEED has effect on pages only if it succeeds
    Michael Kerrisk  [Vlastimil Babka]
        Clarifications for MADV_DONTNEED
    Michael Kerrisk  [Michal Hocko]
        Improve MADV_DONTNEED description
    Michael Kerrisk
        MADV_DONTNEED cannot be applied to Huge TLB or locked pages
    Michael Kerrisk  [Vlastimil Babka]
        Remove mention of "shared pages" as a cause of EINVAL for MADV_DONTNEED
    Michael Kerrisk  [Vlastimil Babka]
        Note Huge TLB as a cause of EINVAL for MADV_DONTNEED
    Michael Kerrisk  [Minchan Kim]
        Add mention of VM_PFNMAP in discussion of MADV_DONTNEED and MADV_REMOVE
    Michael Kerrisk
        Drop sentence saying that kernel may ignore 'advice'
            The sentence creates misunderstandings, and does not really
            add information.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that some Linux-specific 'advice' change memory-access semantics
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: Remove crufty text about "command" versus "advice"
            The point made in this fairly ancient text is more or less evident
            from the DESCRIPTION, and it's not clear what "standard" is being
            referred to.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention POSIX.1-2008 addition of POSIX_MADV_NOREUSE
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove "POSIX.1b" from CONFORMING TO
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move mention of posix_fadvise() from CONFORMING TO to SEE ALSO
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: add EPERM error case for MADV_HWPOISON
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that madvise() is nonstandard, but widespread


Newly documented interfaces in existing pages

    Michael Kerrisk
        (Briefly) document /proc/PID/attr/keycreate
    Michael Kerrisk  [Stephen Smalley]

    Michael Kerrisk
        Document /proc/sys/kernel/auto_msgmni

socket.7
    David Wilson  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Document SO_REUSEPORT socket option


New and changed links
---------------------

get_thread_area.2
    Andy Lutomirski
        Make get_thread_area.2 a link to rewritten set_thread_area.2 page


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

time.1
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make option argument formatting consistent with other pages

access.2
    Denys Vlasenko
        Explain how access() check treats capabilities
            We have users who are terribly confused why their binaries
            with CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE capability see EACCESS from access() calls,
            but are able to read the file.

            The reason is access() isn't the "can I read/write/execute this
            file?" question, it is the "(assuming that I'm a setuid binary,)
            can *the user who invoked me* read/write/execute this file?"
            question.

            That's why it uses real UIDs as documented, and why it ignores
            capabilities when capability-endorsed binaries are run by non-root
            (this patch adds this information).

            To make users more likely to notice this less-known detail,
            the patch expands the explanation with rationale for this logic
            into a separate paragraph.

arch_prctl.2
set_thread_area.2
get_thread_area.2
    Andy Lutomirski
        Improve TLS documentation
            The documentation for set_thread_area was very vague.  This
            improves it, accounts for recent kernel changes, and merges
            it with get_thread_area.2.

            get_thread_area.2 now becomes a link.

            While I'm at it, clarify the related arch_prctl.2 man page.

cacheflush.2
    Ralf Baechle
        Update some portability details and bugs
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer reader to BUGS in discussion of EINVAL error

capget.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document V3 capabilities constants
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite discussion of kernel versions that support file capabilities
            File capabilities ceased to be optional in Linux 2.6.33.

clone.2
    Peng Haitao
        Fix description of CLONE_PARENT_SETTID
            CLONE_PARENT_SETTID only stores child thread ID in parent memory.

clone.2
execve.2
    Kevin Easton
        Document interaction of execve(2) with CLONE_FILES
            This patch the fact that a successful execve(2) in a process that
            is sharing a file descriptor table results in unsharing the table.

            I discovered this through testing and verified it by source
            inspection - there is a call to unshare_files() early in
            do_execve_common().

fcntl.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jeff Layton]
        Clarify cases of conflict between traditional record and OFD locks
            Verified by experiment on Linux 3.15 and 3.19rc4.

fork.2
    Michal Hocko
        EAGAIN is not reported when task allocation fails
            I am not sure why we have:

               "EAGAIN fork() cannot allocate sufficient memory to copy
                the parent's page tables and allocate a task structure
                or the child."

            The text seems to be there from the time when man-pages
            were moved to git so there is no history for it.

            And it doesn't reflect reality: the kernel reports both
            dup_task_struct and dup_mm failures as ENOMEM to the
            userspace. This seems to be the case from early 2.x times
            so let's simply remove this part.
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Child and parent run in separate memory spaces
            fork.2 should clearly point out that child and parent
            process run in separate memory spaces.
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: add "C library/kernel ABI differences" subheading

getpid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: add "C library/kernel ABI differences" subheading

getxattr.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Various rewordings plus one or two details clarified
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add pointer to example in listxattr(2)

killpg.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: add "C library/kernel ABI differences" subheading

listxattr.2
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Provide example program
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reword discussion of size==0 case
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add note on handling increases in sizes of keys or values
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove mention of which filesystems implement ACLs
            Such a list will only become outdated (as it already was).

migrate_pages.2
    Jan Stancek
        Document EFAULT and EINVAL errors
            I encountered these errors while writing testcase for migrate_pages
            syscall for LTP (Linux test project).

            I checked stable kernel tree 3.5 to see which paths return these.
            Both can be returned from get_nodes(), which is called from:
            SYSCALL_DEFINE4(migrate_pages, pid_t, pid, unsigned long, maxnode,
                            const unsigned long __user *, old_nodes,
                            const unsigned long __user *, new_nodes)

            The testcase does following:

modify_ldt.2
    Andy Lutomirski
        Overhaul the documentation
            This clarifies the behavior and documents all four functions.
    Andy Lutomirski
        Clarify the lm bit's behavior
            The lm bit should never have existed in the first place.  Sigh.

mprotect.2
    Mark Seaborn
        Mention effect of READ_IMPLIES_EXEC personality flag
            I puzzled over mprotect()'s effect on /proc/*/maps for a while
            yesterday -- it was setting "x" without PROT_EXEC being specified.
            Here is a patch to add some explanation.

msgget.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add details of MSGMNI default value

msgop.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify wording of MSGMAX and MSGMNB limits

perf_event_open.2
    Vince Weaver
        Clarify PERF_EVENT_IOC_REFRESH behavior
            Currently the PERF_EVENT_IOC_REFRESH ioctl, when applied to a group
            leader, will refresh all children.  Also if a refresh value of 0
            is chosen then the refresh becomes infinite (never runs out).
            Back in 2011 PAPI was relying on these behaviors but I was told
            that both were unsupported and subject to being removed at any time.
            (See https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/5/24/337 )
            However the behavior has not been changed.

            This patch updates the manpage to still list the behavior as
            unsupported, but removes the inaccurate description of it
            only being a problem with 2.6 kernels.

prctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Bill McConnaughey]
        Mention file capabilities in discussion of PR_SET_DUMPABLE
    Michael Kerrisk
        Greatly expand discussion of "dumpable" flag
            In particular, detail the interactions with
            /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reorder paragraphs describing PR_SET_DUMPABLE
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention SUID_DUMP_DISABLE and SUID_DUMP_USER under PR_SET_DUMPABLE
    Michael Kerrisk
        Executing a file with capabilities also resets the parent death signal

ptrace.2
    James Hunt
        Explain behaviour should ptrace tracer call execve(2)
            This behaviour was verified by reading the kernel source and
            confirming the behaviour using a test program.
    Denys Vlasenko
        Add information on PTRACE_SEIZE versus PTRACE_ATTACH differences
            Extend description of PTRACE_SEIZE with the short summary of its
            differences from PTRACE_ATTACH.

            The following paragraph:

            PTRACE_EVENT_STOP
                   Stop induced by PTRACE_INTERRUPT command, or group-stop, or ini-
                   tial  ptrace-stop when a new child is attached (only if attached
                   using PTRACE_SEIZE), or PTRACE_EVENT_STOP if PTRACE_SEIZE was used.

            has an editing error (the part after last comma makes no sense).
            Removing it.

            Mention that legacy post-execve SIGTRAP is disabled by PTRACE_SEIZE.

sched_setattr.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Christophe Blaess]
        SYNOPSIS: remove 'const' from 'attr' sched_getattr() argument

semget.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note default value for SEMMNI and SEMMSL

    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that zero-length attribute values are permitted
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework text describing 'flags' argument

stat.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: add "C library/kernel ABI differences" subheading

statfs.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jan Chaloupka]
        Document the 'f_flags' field added in Linux 2.6.36
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that 'statfs' structure has some padding bytes
            The number of padding bytes has changed over time, as some
            bytes are used, so describe this aspect of the structure
            less explicitly.
    Tao Ma
        Add OCFS2_SUPER_MAGIC
    Michael Kerrisk
        Use __fsword_t in statfs structure definition
            This more closely matches modern glibc reality.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add a note on the __fsword_t type
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document 'f_spare' more vaguely

wait.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that waitpid() is a wrapper for wait4()
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that wait() is a library function implemented via wait4()

wait4.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: add "C library/kernel ABI differences" subheading

encrypt.3
    Rob Somers
        Improve code example
            I (and some others) found that the original example code
            did not seem to work as advertised.  The new code (used by
            permission of the original author, Jens Thoms Toerring)
            was found on comp.os.linux.development.

mktemp.3
    Luke Faraone
        DESCRIPTION reference to BUGS corrected
            mktemp(3)'s DESCRIPTION referenced NOTES, but no such
            section exists. Corrected to refer to BUGS.

pthread_attr_setschedparam.3
    Tobias Herzke
        Describe EINVAL in ERRORS

resolver.3
host.conf.5
    Simon Paillard
        host.conf 'order' option deprecated, replaced by nsswitch.conf(5)
            http://www.sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2389
            http://repo.or.cz/w/glibc.git/commit/b9c65d0902e5890c4f025b574725154032f8120a

            Reported at http://bugs.debian.org/270368,
            http://bugs.debian.org/396633, and http://bugs.debian.org/344233.

statvfs.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document missing 'f_flag' bit values
            And reorganize information relating to which flags are in
            POSIX.1.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jan Chaloupka]
        statvfs() now populates 'f_flag' from  statfs()'s f_flag field
            These changes came with glibc 2.13, and the kernel's addition of
            a 'f_flags' field in Linux 2.6.36.

syslog.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Doug Goldstein]
        Remove unneeded <stdarg.h>
            vsyslog() does not need this.

tzset.3
    J William Piggott
        Add offset format
            tzset.3 does not illustrate the POSIX offset format.
            Specifically, there is no indication in the manual
            what the optional components of it are.

random.4
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note maximum number of bytes returned by read(2) on /dev/random
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mathieu Malaterre]
        Since Linux 3.16, reads from /dev/urandom return at most 32 MB
            See https://bugs.debian.org/775328 and
            https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=80981#c9

core.5
    Michael Kerrisk  [Bill McConnaughey]
        Executing a file that has capabilities also prevents core dumps
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document "%i" and "%I" core_pattern specifiers

intro.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove words "and protocols"
            There are no protocol descriptions in Section 5. Protocols are
            in Section 7.

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add reference to prctl(2) in discussion of /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable
            And note that /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable defines the
            value assigned to the process "dumpable" flag in certain
            circumstances.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that CAP_SYS_ADMIN is required to list /proc/PID/map_files
            This might however change in the future; see the Jan 2015 LKML thread:

                    Re: [RFC][PATCH v2] procfs: Always expose /proc/<pid>/map_files/
                                        and make it readable

resolv.conf.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add nsswitch.conf(5)

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS as an alternative to prctl() PR_SET_KEEPCAPS
    Chris Mayo
        NOTES: add last kernel versions for obsolete options
            The CONFIG_SECURITY_CAPABILITIES option was removed by
            commit 5915eb53861c5776cfec33ca4fcc1fd20d66dd27

            The CONFIG_SECURITY_FILE_CAPABILITIES option removed in
            Linux 2.6.33 as already mentioned in DESCRIPTION.

pthreads.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add fork(2)

unix.7
    Jan Chaloupka
        Mention SOCK_STREAM socket for ioctl_type of ioctl()
            from https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1110401.

            unix.7 is not clear about socket type of ioctl_type argument of
            ioctl() function. The description of SIOCINQ is applicable only
            for SOCK_STREAM socket. For SOCK_DGRAM, udp(7) man page gives
            correct description of SIOCINQ

ldconfig.8
    Michael Kerrisk
        Place options in alphabetical order
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note glibc version number for '-l' option
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document -c/--format option
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add long form of some options
    Michael Kerrisk  [Patrick Horgan]
        ld.so.conf uses only newlines as delimiters
            mtk: confirmed by reading source of parse_conf() in
            elf/ldconfig.c.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document -V/--version option
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document -i/--ignore-aux-cache option

ld.so.8
    Michael Kerrisk
        Relocate "Hardware capabilities" to be a subsection under notes
            This is more consistent with standard man-pages headings
            and layout.
    Michael Kerrisk
        (Briefly) document LD_TRACE_PRELINKING
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove duplicate description of LD_BIND_NOT

clone.2
    Josh Triplett
        Document that clone() silently ignores CLONE_PID and CLONE_STOPPED
            Normally, system calls return EINVAL for flags they don't support.
            Explicitly document that clone does *not* produce an error for
            these two obsolete flags.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Small rewording of explanation of clone() wrt threads
            Clone has so many effects that it's an oversimplification to say
            that the *main* use of clone is to create a thread.  (In fact,
            the use of clone() to create new processes may well be more
            common, since glibc's fork() is a wrapper that calls clone().)

getgroups.2

        Add discussion of NPTL credential-changing mechanism
            At the kernel level, credentials (UIDs and GIDs) are a per-thread
            attribute. NPTL uses a signal-based mechanism to ensure that
            when one thread changes its credentials, all other threads change
            credentials to the same values. By this means, the NPTL
            implementation conforms to the POSIX requirement that the threads
            in a process share credentials.

            I recently realized that I had been reasoning improperly about
            what umount(MNT_DETACH) did based on an insufficient description
            in the umount.2 man page, that matched my intuition but not the
            implementation.

            When there are no submounts, MNT_DETACH is essentially harmless to
            applications.  Where there are submounts, MNT_DETACH changes what
            is visible to applications using the detach directories.

            are using symbols in this library*. That latter text has
            been there since man-pages-1.29, but it seems rather dubious.
            How could the implementation know whether other libraries
            are still using symbols in this library? Furthermore, no
            other implementation's man page mentions this point.
            Seems best to drop this point.

            part of commit 72a3effaf633bcae9034b7e176bdbd78d64a71db.

user_namespaces.7
    Eric W. Biederman
        Update the documentation to reflect the fixes for negative groups
            Files with access permissions such as rwx---rwx give fewer
            permissions to their group then they do to everyone else.  Which
            means dropping groups with setgroups(0, NULL) actually grants a
            process privileges.

            The unprivileged setting of gid_map turned out not to be safe
            after this change.  Privileged setting of gid_map can be
            interpreted as meaning yes it is ok to drop groups. [ Eric
            additionally noted: Setting of gid_map with privilege has been
            clarified to mean that dropping groups is ok.  This allows
            existing programs that set gid_map with privilege to work
            without changes.  That is, newgidmap(1) continues to work
            unchanged.]

            To prevent this problem and future problems, user namespaces were
            changed in such a way as to guarantee a user can not obtain
            credentials without privilege that they could not obtain without
            the help of user namespaces.

            This meant testing the effective user ID and not the filesystem
            user ID, as setresuid(2) and setregid(2) allow setting any process
            UID or GID (except the supplementary groups) to the effective ID.

            Furthermore, to preserve in some form the useful applications
            that have been setting gid_map without privilege, the file
            /proc/[pid]/setgroups was added to allow disabling setgroups(2).
            With setgroups(2) permanently disabled in a user namespace, it
            again becomes safe to allow writes to gid_map without privilege.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework some text describing permission rules for updating map files
            No (intentional) change to the facts, but this restructuring
            should make the meaning easier to grasp.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update kernel version associated with 5-line limit for map files
            As at Linux 3.18, the limit is still five lines, so mention the
            more recent kernel version in the text.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Alban Crequy]
        Handle /proc/PID/setgroups in the example program
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework text describing restrictions on updating /proc/PID/setgroups
            No (intentional) changes to factual description, but the
            restructured text is hopefully easier to grasp.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain why the /proc/PID/setgroups file was added

ldconfig.8
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note use of /lib64 and /usr/lib64 on some 64-bit architectures

ld.so.8
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note the use of /lib64 and /usr/lib64 on some 64-bit architectures

posix_madvise.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        New page documenting posix_madvise(3)

ftw.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reorganize the page to give primacy to nftw()

Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

getdents.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Dima Tisnek]
        Document getdents64()
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14795

Global changes
--------------

Various section 3 math pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that these functions are also in POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

getent.1
    Robin H. Johnson
        Document options
            The options to getent are now documented, after being around for
            nearly a decade without changes.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document help and version options

fallocate.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix kernel version number for FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE
            FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE was added in 3.15, not 3.14.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that SMB3 added FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE support in Linux 3.17

getrlimit.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that the underlying system call for prlimit() is prlimit64()
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove "_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64" from prlimit() FTM requirements
            "_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64" is not needed to get the prlimit()
            declaration.

ioctl_list.2
    Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos
        SIOCADDRT accepts in6_rtmsg in INET6 protocol
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        TFD_IOC_SET_TICKS
            timerfd_create.2 mentions TFD_IOC_SET_TICKS. We should add it to
            ioctl_list.2, too.

llseek.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Advise reader to use lseek(2) instead
    Michael Kerrisk
        llseek() exists on 32-bit platforms to support seeking to large offsets

madvise.2
    David Rientjes
        Specify MADV_REMOVE returns EINVAL for hugetlbfs
            madvise(2) actually returns with error EINVAL for MADV_REMOVE
            when used for hugetlb VMAs, not EOPNOTSUPP, and this has been
            the case since MADV_REMOVE was introduced in commit f6b3ec238d12
            ("madvise(MADV_REMOVE): remove pages from tmpfs shm backing
            store"). Specify the exact behavior.
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add posix_madvise(2)

    Michael Kerrisk
        Add "C library/kernel ABI differences" subsection

seccomp.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Pierre Chifflier, Kees Cook]
        Note that seccomp_data is read-only

stat.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some details on various "stat" versions
            Three versions of "stat" appeared on 32-bit systems,
            dealing with structures of different (increasing) sizes.
            Explain some of the details, and also note that the
            situation is simpler on modern 64-bit architectures.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add mention of newfstatat()
            The underlying system call for fstatat() is newfstatat()
            on some architectures.

symlink.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jonny Grant]
        ERRORS: add linkpath=="" case for ENOENT

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove prlimit()
            There really is only the prlimit64() system call.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some details about the "multiple versions of system calls"
            The multiple-system-call-version phenomenon is particularly a
            feature of older 32-bit platforms. Hint at that fact in the text.

timerfd_create.2
    Cyrill Gorcunov  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Document TFD_IOC_SET_TICKS ioctl() operation
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some details to C library/kernel ABI differences

ftw.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Felix Sedlmeier]
        ftw() and nftw() differ for the non-stat-able symlink case
            The POSIX specification of ftw() says that an un-stat-able
            symlink may yield either FTW_NS or FTW_SL. The specification
            of nftw() does not carry this statement.
    Michael Kerrisk

    Walter Harms  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Simplify the example code

qsort.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rob Landley]
        alphasort() and versionsort() are not suitable for 'compar'
            In glibc 2.10, the prototypes of alphasort() and versionsort()
            were changed so that the arguments switched from 'const void *' to
            'const struct dirent **', to match the POSIX.1-2008 specification
            of alphasort(). As such, compiler warnings will result if
            these functions are used as the arguments of qsort().

                warning: passing argument 4 of 'qsort' from incompatible
                pointer type
                expected '__compar_fn_t' but argument is of type
                'int (*)(const struct dirent **, const struct dirent **)'

            Therefore, remove the ancient NOTES text suggesting that
            alphasort() and versionsort() can be used as suitable
            'compar' arguments for qsort().

realpath.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jon Grant]
        Add ENOMEM error

scandir.3
    Michael Kerrisk

    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that abstract sockets are included in /proc/net/unix
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update description /proc/sys/unix 'Type' field
            The existing text was very crufty. UNIX domain sockets
            support more than SOCK_STREAM for a _very_ long time now.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some detail to /proc/PID/timers

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

get_phys_pages.3
    William Woodruff
        Document get_phys_pages() and get_avphys_pages()

loop.4
    Urs Thuermann, Michael Kerrisk
        New page documenting the loop device

xattr.7
    Andreas Gruenbacher
        Import attr(5) man page from the 'attr' project
            After discussions with Andreas Gruenbacher, it makes sense to
            move this page into man-pages, since it mostly relates to
            kernel details. Since this is an overview page,
            we'll move it to Section 7.
    Michael Kerrisk
         Rename page
            "xattr" is a more meaningful name than "attr" (it resonates
            with the names of the system calls), so as long as we are
            moving the page to a new section, we'll change the name as well,
            and retain an acl(5) link so that old references remain valid.

mknod.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewordings + point reader at stat(2) for details of mode bits

mmap.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove text that implies that munmap() syncs MAP_SHARED mapping to file
            The existing text in this page:

                   MAP_SHARED Share  this  mapping.   Updates to the mapping
                              are visible to other processes that  map  this
                              file,  and are carried through to the underly‐
                              ing  file.   The  file  may  not  actually  be
                              updated until msync(2) or munmap() is called.

            implies that munmap() will sync the mapping to the underlying
            file. POSIX doesn't require this, and some light reading of the
            code and some light testing (fsync() after munmap() of a large
            file) also indicates that Linux doesn't do this.

msync.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework text of DESCRIPTION
            Rewrite the text somewhat, for easier comprehension.
            No (intentional) changes to factual content

        Improve description of some mode constants
    Michael Kerrisk  [Andreas Grünbacher]

    Michael Kerrisk
        Add text on POSIX terms "file mode bits" and "file permission bits"
            Recent changes to various pages employ this distinction.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Tighten wording: use 'mode bit' rather than 'permission bit'
            According to POSIX, the 9 UGO*RWX bits are permissions, and
            'mode' is used to refer to collectively to those bits plus sticky,
            set-UID, and set_GID bits.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15952

CPU_SET.3
    Chris Metcalf
        Clarify language about "available" cpus
            The CPU_SET.3 man page uses the adjective "available" when
            explaining what the argument to CPU_SET() means.  This is
            confusing, since "available" isn't well-defined.  The kernel
            has a set of adjectives (possible, present, online, and active)
            that qualify cpus, but normally none of these are what the
            cpu_set_t bit index means: it's just "which cpu", using the
            kernel's internal numbering system, even if that cpu isn't
            possible or present.

            This change removes the word "available" and adds a sentence
            warning that cpu sets may not be contiguous due to dynamic
            cpu hotplug, etc.

        Update discussion of 'debug' option
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97161
    Michael Kerrisk
        Summary of multiple changes: remove cruft from this page.
            Much of the detail on hardware specifics in this page dates
            from the 20th century. (The last major update to this page was in
            man-pages-1.14!) It's hugely out of date now (many of these
            devices disappeared from the kernel years ago.) So, I've taken
            a large scythe to the page to remove anything that looks
            seriously dated. In the process, the page has shrunk to less
            than 50% of its previous size.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove "buff=" details
            This seems to have gone away in Linux 2.2.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty "Mouse drivers" options
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty "General non-device-specific boot arguments" options
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty "Hard disks" options
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty "mem=" details
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty details on IBM MCA bus devices
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove 'swap=" details
            This seems to have gone away in Linux 2.2,
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty floppy disk driver options
            In the specific case of floppy drives: the drivers still
            exist, but it's been a while since most of saw these devices
            in the wild. So, just refer the reader to the kernel source
            file for details. (The detail in this man page was after all
            originally drawn from that file.)
        Remove crufty "ISDN drivers" options
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty "line printer driver" options
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty "Serial port drivers" options
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty reference to CONFIG_BUGi386
            That option disappeared in Linux 2.4.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty text
            "bootsetups array" dates from Linux 2.0.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty "Video hardware" options
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty SCSI device driver options

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35852
    Michael Kerrisk
        Relocate misplaced text describing ENOPROTOOPT error

packet.7
    Graham Shaw
        Add sll_protocol to list of required fields for outbound packets

pthreads.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [KOSAKI Motohiro]
        Using thread IDs whose lifetime has expired gives undefined behavior
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53061

raw.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Tetsuo Handa]
        For incoming datagrams, sin_port is set to zero
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention sendto(), recvfrom(), and so on when discussing address format
            This gives the reader a little context for the following
            discussion of 'sin_port'.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty reference to <netinet/in.h>
    Michael Kerrisk
        Replace reference to RFC 1700 with pointer to IANA protocol number list

    Michael Kerrisk  [Steinar H. Gunderson]
        Clarify that I/O operations on disks are not interrupted by signals
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97721

unix.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Christophe Lohr]
        Remove mention of UNIX_PATH_MAX
            This kernel constant is not exposed to user space.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note the 108 bytes for sun_path is how things are done on Linux
            And refer the reader to NOTES for discussion of portability.

xattr.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document EA limits for Btrfs
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document VFS-imposed limits on EAs
            VFS imposes a 255-byte limit on EA names, and a 64kB limit on
            EA values.
    Michael Kerrisk
        The ext[234] block limitation applies to sum of all EAs
            It is not a per-EA limit.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify permissions required to work with 'user' EAs
    Michael Kerrisk
        ext2 and ext3 no longer need mounting with 'user_xattr' for user EAs
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add various relevant pages to SEE ALSO
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add CONFORMING TO section
    Michael Kerrisk
        Modify headings to man-pages norms
    Michael Kerrisk
        Btrfs also supports extended attributes
    Michael Kerrisk
        File capabilities are implemented using *security* attributes
            Not *system* attributes
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe limit on EA values for JFS, XFS, and Reiserfs
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explicitly mention some of the xattr system calls in DESCRIPTION
            Naming the system calls helps to orient the reader

nscd.8
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add mention of 'services' and 'netgroup' databases
            This makes the page consistent with nscd.conf(5).

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

bpf.2
    Alexei Starovoitov, Michael Kerrisk  [Daniel Borkmann]
        New page documenting bpf(2)

__ppc_get_timebase.3
    Tulio Magno Quites Machado Filho
        New page documenting __ppc_get_timebase() and __ppc_get_timebase_freq()
            Glibc 2.16 was released with a new function for the Power
            architecture that can read its Time Base Register.
            Glibc 2.17 adds a function to read the frequency at which the Time
            Base Register of Power processors is updated.

queue.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [David Leppik, Doug Klima]
        Reimport from latest FreeBSD page
            Long ago, Doug Klima noted that many macros were not
            documented in the queue(3) page. Fix by reimporting from
            latest [1] FreeBSD man page.

            [1] Revision 263142, Modified Fri Mar 14 03:07:51 2014 UTC

            This time, I'll learn from past mistakes and not convert
            from 'mdoc' to 'man' macros.

Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk  [Andries E. Brouwer]
        Remove "ABI" from "C library/kernel ABI differences" subheadings
            The "ABI" doesn't really convey anything significant in
            the title. These subsections are about describing differences
            between the kernel and (g)libc interfaces.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

intro.1
    Michael Kerrisk  [Andries E. Brouwer]
        Drop intro paragraph on '$?' shell variable
            As Andries notes, this piece of text is rather out of place in
            a page that was intended to provide a tutorial introduction for
            beginners logging in on a Linux system.

locale.1
    Marko Myllynen
        A minor output format clarification
            A minor clarification for the locale output format which was
            brought up at
            https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=18516.

            For reference, see
            https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=18516
            http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/locale.html

        Add CONFORMING TO section

capget.2
    Julian Orth
        Clarify that hdrp->pid==0 is equivalent gettid() not getpid()

chroot.2
    Jann Horn
        chroot() is not intended for security; document attack
            It is unfortunate that this discourages this use of chroot(2)
            without pointing out alternative solutions - for example,
            OpenSSH and vsftpd both still rely on chroot(2) for security.

            Bind mounts should theoretically be usable as a replacement, but
            currently, they have a similar problem (CVE-2015-2925) that hasn't
            been fixed in ~6 months, so I'd rather not add it to the manpage
            as a solution before a fix lands.

clock_getres.2
    Zeng Linggang
        ATTRIBUTES: Note functions that are thread-safe

eventfd.2
    Zeng Linggang
        ATTRIBUTES: Note function that is thread-safe

execve.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Elaborate on envp/argv as NULL behavior

_exit.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Open stdio frames are not flushed, temporary files are deleted
            Many years ago, text was added to the page saying that it is
            implementation-dependent whether stdio streams are flushed and
            whether temporary are removed. In part, this change appears to
            be because POSIX.1-2001 added text related to this point.
            However, that seems to have been an error in POSIX, and the
            text was subsequently removed for POSIX.1-2008. See
            https://collaboration.opengroup.org/austin/interps/documents/9984/AI-085.txt
            Austin Group Interpretation reference 1003.1-2001 #085

fallocate.2
    Namjae Jeon  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Document FALLOC_FL_INSERT_RANGE
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since Linux 4.2, ext4 supports FALLOC_FL_INSERT_RANGE

gettid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that for a thread group leader, gettid() == getpid()

iopl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove some historical libc5 and glibc 1 details
            These details are ancient, and long ago ceased to be relevant.

ioprio_set.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jens Axboe]
        Document meaning of ioprio==0

mlock.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mehdi Aqadjani Memar]
        Document another ENOMEM error case
            ENOMEM can occur if locking/unlocking in the middle of a region
            would increase the number of VMAs beyond the system limit (64k).

mmap.2
    Michal Hocko  [Eric B Munson]
        Clarify MAP_POPULATE
            David Rientjes has noticed that MAP_POPULATE wording might promise
            much more than the kernel actually provides and intends to provide.
            The primary usage of the flag is to pre-fault the range. There is
            no guarantee that no major faults will happen later on. The pages
            might have been reclaimed by the time the process tries to access
            them.
    Michal Hocko  [Eric B Munson]
        Clarify MAP_LOCKED semantics
            MAP_LOCKED had a subtly different semantic from mmap(2)+mlock(2)
            since it has been introduced.
            mlock(2) fails if the memory range cannot get populated to
            guarantee that no future major faults will happen on the range.
            mmap(MAP_LOCKED) on the other hand silently succeeds even if
            the range was populated only partially.

            Fixing this subtle difference in the kernel is rather awkward
            because the memory population happens after mm locks have been
            dropped and so the cleanup before returning failure (munlock)
            could operate on something else than the originally mapped area.

            E.g. speculative userspace page fault handler catching SEGV and
            doing mmap(fault_addr, MAP_FIXED|MAP_LOCKED) might discard portion
            of a racing mmap and lead to lost data. Although it is not clear
            whether such a usage would be valid, mmap page doesn't explicitly
            describe requirements for threaded applications so we cannot
            exclude this possibility.

            This patch makes the semantic of MAP_LOCKED explicit and suggests
            using mmap + mlock as the only way to guarantee no later major
            page faults.
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: point out that ENOMEM can occur even for munmap()

mprotect.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note ENOMEM error that can occur when we reach limit on maximum VMAs

open.2
read.2
write.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mike Hayward]
        Clarify that O_NONBLOCK is a no-op for regular files and block devices

perf_event_open.2
    Vince Weaver  [Joerg Roedel]
        Exclude_host/exclude_guest clarification
            This patch relates to the exclude_host and exclude_guest bits added
            by the following commit:

               exclude_host, exclude_guest; Linux 3.2
                    commit a240f76165e6255384d4bdb8139895fac7988799
                    Author: Joerg Roedel <joerg.roedel@amd.com>
                    Date:   Wed Oct 5 14:01:16 2011 +0200

                        perf, core: Introduce attrs to count in either host or guest mode

            The updated manpage text clarifies that the "exclude_host" and
            "exclude_guest" perf_event_open() attr bits only apply in the
            context of a KVM environment and are currently x86 only.
    Vince Weaver
        Document PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_INTR
            This patch relates to the addition of PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_INTR
            support added in the following commit:

                perf_sample_regs_intr; Linux 3.19
                commit 60e2364e60e86e81bc6377f49779779e6120977f
                Author: Stephane Eranian <eranian@google.com>

                        perf: Add ability to sample machine state on interrupt

            The primary difference between PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_INTR and the
            existing PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_USER is that the new support will
            return kernel register values.  Also if precise_ip is
            set higher than 0 then the PEBS register state will be returned
            rather than the saved interrupt state.

            This patch incorporates feedback from Stephane Eranian and
            Andi Kleen.

prctl.2
seccomp.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that SECCOMP_SET_MODE_STRICT disallows exit_group(2)
            These days, glibc implements _exit() as a wrapper around
            exit_group(2). (When seccomp was originally introduced, this was
            not the case.) Give the reader a clue that, despite what glibc is
            doing, what SECCOMP_SET_MODE_STRICT permits is the true _exit(2)
            system call, and not exit_group(2).

pread.2
read.2
readv.2
sendfile.2
write.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that Linux limits transfers to a maximum of 0x7ffff000 bytes
            See https://bugs.debian.org/629994 and
            https://bugs.debian.org/630029.

pread.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite RETURN VALUE section
            (Also drop the text on pwrite() returning zero; that seems bogus.)

ptrace.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Vegard Nossum]
        PTRACE_O_TRACEEXIT clarification

readv.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove BUGS heading
            The text on mixing I/O syscalls and stdio is a general point
            of behavior. It's not a bug as such.

    Michael Kerrisk  [Florian Weimer]
        Explain how to deal with 1024-CPU limitation of glibc's cpu_set_t type
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention the use of the 'isolcpus' kernel boot option

sched_setattr.2
    Julian Orth
        Remove a const attribute
            The attr argument of sched_setattr was documented as const but the
            kernel will modify the size field of this struct if it contains an
            invalid value. See the documentation of the size field for details.

        ATTRIBUTES: Note functions that are thread-safe
            After research, We think utimensat() and futimens() are thread-safe.
            But, there are not markings of utimensat() and futimens() in glibc
            document.

        Clarify terminology
            In the "RETURN VALUE" section the word item is in italics
            as if it were one of the function parameters. But the word
            "item" occurs here for the first time, earlier the text
            uses "element". [Patch improves this.]

gethostbyname.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Laszlo Ersek]
        Remove mention of IPv6 addresses, which are not supported
            As reported by Laszlo Ersek:

                gethostbyname(3) fails to resolve the IPv6 address "::1",
                but the manual page says: "If name is an IPv4 or IPv6 address,
                no lookup is performed and gethostbyname() simply copies name
                into the h_name field [...]".

                It seems that the glibc behavior is conformant, and the manual
                page is in error.

console_codes.4
    Scot Doyle  [Pavel Machek, Michael Kerrisk]
        Add CSI sequence for cursor blink interval
            Add a Console Private CSI sequence to specify the current
            console's cursor blink interval. The interval is specified
            as a number of milliseconds until the next cursor display
            state toggle, from 50 to 65535.

null.4
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that reads from /dev/zero are interruptible since Linux 2.6.31

core.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention 'coredump_filter' boot option

host.conf.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Wording fix: s/resolv+/the resolver library/
            The term "resolv+" seems to be historical cruft.

hosts.equiv.5
    Carlos O'Donell
        Fix format, clarify IdM needs, and provide examples.
            In some recent work with a Red Hat customer I had the opportunity
            to discuss the fine nuances of the ruserok() function and related
            API which are used to implement rlogin and rsh.

            It came to my attention after working with QE on some automated
            internal testing that there were no good examples in the hosts.equiv
            manual page showing how the format was supposed to work for this
            file and for ~/.rhosts, worse the "format" line showed that there
            should be spaces between arguments when that would clearly lead
            to incorrect behaviour. In addition some things that the format
            allows you to write are just wrong like "-host -user" which makes
            no sense since the host is already rejected, and should be written
            as "host -user" instead. I added notes in the example to make it
            clear that "-host -user" is invalid.

            I fixed three things:

            (a) The format line.
            - Either +, or [-]hostname, or +@netgrp or -@netgrp.
            - Either +, or [-]username, or +@netgrp or -@netgrp.
            - You must specify something in the hostname portion so remove
              optional brackets.

            (b) Clarify language around credentials
            - If the host is not trusted you must provide credentials to
              the login system and that could be anything really and it
              depends on your configuration e.g. PAM or whatever IdM you have.

            (c) Provide real-world examples
            - Provide several real world examples and some corner case
              examples for how you would write something. Hopefully others
              can add examples as they see fit.

            This patch completes the LC_TIME section - since these era
            keywords are so tightly coupled, I'm providing them as a
            single patch.

        Refer to locale(7) more prominently
            It's probably a good idea to refer to locale(7) so that a reader
            can check what a category is about before describing them in
            detail.

    Marko Myllynen
        Remove the FIXME for timezone
            The timezone of LC_TIME is not in POSIX, only 6 (out of ~300)
            glibc locales define it, the glibc code comment below from
            glibc.git/programs/ld-time.c seems to suggest it's not a good
            idea, and there's been a proposal in upstream [1] to remove the
            existing timezone definitions from glibc locales so I think
            it's actually better to leave this one undocumented:

            /* XXX We don't perform any tests on the timezone value since this is
               simply useless, stupid $&$!@...  */

            1) https://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2015-06/msg00098.html

            Move the remaining LC_COLLATE FIXMEs together while at it.
    Marko Myllynen
        Fix country_isbn format
            Both plain numbers and Unicode code points are used in
            glibc locales but checking the code reveals that country_isbn
            is handled like the rest of its category expect for country_num
            which was clarified earlier.
    Marko Myllynen
        Sort according to the standard
            Sort the options so that those defined in POSIX are listed first,
            then followed by those defined in ISO/IEC TR 14652 in the order
            of common convention in many widely used glibc locales.

            Actual descriptions are unchanged.

            http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap07.html
    Marko Myllynen
        Refer to strftime(3) where appropriate
            The relationship between the locale time format syntax
            and strftime() cannot be considered as obvious.
    Marko Myllynen
        Document map "totitle"
            See e.g. locales/i18n for reference.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Marko Myllynen]
        Remove BUGS section saying man page is not complete
            To some degree, this is true of many pages. And anyway, this
            page is much better after recent work by Marko.

    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer to bpf(2) for explanation of /proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_enable

repertoiremap.5
    Marko Myllynen
        Symbolic names AKA mnemonics
            A long time ago in glibc, repertoire maps were used (but they
            were removed already in 2000), those mapping files were named
            as mnemonics, so "mnemonic" is a term that would almost
            certainly come up if somebody studies glibc side (perhaps even
            the related standards like ISO 9945 [which I don't have access
            to]) so I thought it's worth to mention to term in the man page
            to make sure we're talking about the same thing, otherwise
            someone might wonder is that something different or not.

            IOW, symbolic names and mnemonics are often used interchangeably,
            let's mention the other often used term in the page, too.

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        CAP_SYS_ADMIN allows calling bpf(2)

locale.7
    Marko Myllynen
        LC_CTYPE determines transliteration rules on glibc systems

packet.7
    文剑  [Cortland Setlow]
        Fix description of binding a packet socket to an interface

pty.7
    NeilBrown  [Peter Hurley]
        Clarify asynchronous nature of PTY I/O
            A PTY is not like a pipe - there may be delayed between data
            being written at one end and it being available at the other.

            This became particularly apparent after
                 commit f95499c3030f
                ("n_tty: Don't wait for buffer work in read() loop")
            in Linux 3.12

                Subject Re: [PATCH bisected regression] input_available_p()
                            sometimes says 'no' when it should say 'yes'

rtld-audit.7
    Ben Woodard
        Use correct printf() specifier for pointer types
            In the example code you used %x rather than %p in the example
            code for an audit library. The problem is that it truncates the
            pointers on 64b platforms. So you get something like:

            la_symbind64(): symname = strrchr sym->st_value = 0x7f4b8a3f8960
            ndx = 222 flags = 0x0 refcook = 8b53e5c8 defcook = 8b537e30

            rather than:

            la_symbind64(): symname = fclose sym->st_value = 0x7fa452dd49b0
            ndx = 1135 flags = 0x0 refcook = 0x7fa453f395c8 defcook = 0x7fa453f32e30

            This has bitten me a handful of times when playing around with
            audit test libraries to investigate its behavior.

sched.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove ancient, wildly optimistic prediction about future of RT patches
            It seems the patches were not merged by 2.6.30...

Global changes
--------------

Very many pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update CONFORMING TO section to reflect POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008
        details. (By now, I believe all pages should be up to date with
        respect to appropriately mentioning POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008.)

ldd.1
sprof.1
execve.2
dlopen.3
ld.so.8
    Michael Kerrisk
        Prefer "shared object" over "shared library"
            The man pages variously use "shared library" or "shared object".
            Try to more consistently use one term ("shared object"), while
            also pointing out on a few pages that the terms are synonymous.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

accept.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add mention of POSIX.1-2008 regarding EAGAIN vs EWOULDBLOCK

bpf.2
    Daniel Borkmann
        Various updates/follow-ups to address some fixmes
            A couple of follow-ups to the bpf(2) man-page, besides others:

             * Description of map data types
             * Explanation on eBPF tail calls and program arrays
             * Paragraph on tc holding ref of the eBPF program in the kernel
             * Updated ASCII image with tc ingress and egress invocations
             * __sync_fetch_and_add() and example usage mentioned on arrays
             * minor reword on the licensing and other minor fixups

execve.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reword text on POSIX and #!

io_getevents.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note return value on interruption by a signal handler
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify details of return value for timeout-expired case
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify and extend discussion of 'timeout' argument

mmap.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that 'length' need not be a page-size multiple for munmap()
    Michael Kerrisk  [David Rientjes, David Rientjes, Mike Kravetz]
        Describe mmap()/munmap() argument requirements for huge-page mappings
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move discussion of timestamps to NOTES
            A straight move; no changes to the content.
            This content is better placed in NOTES.

seccomp.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: mention libseccomp pages
        SEE ALSO: add scmp_sys_resolver(1)

sigaction.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Correct the list of flags that were added in POSIX.1-2001

socketpair.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Goswin von Brederlow]
        Clarify use of SOCK_* flags in 'type' argument
            See http://bugs.debian.org/794217

atexit.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add dlopen(3)

clock_getcpuclockid.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Improve wording of EPERM error
            It's imprecise to say that this is an "optional" error
            in POSIX.1.

dl_iterate_phdr.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that 'size' allows callback() to discover structure extensions
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add dladdr(3)
    Michael Kerrisk
        CONFORMING TO: note that this function appears on some other systems

fseeko.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty NOTES section
            This ancient System V detail is unneeded.

getutent.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention POSIX.1-2008 for the "utmpx" functions

iconv_close.3
iconv_open.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        CONFORMING TO: change "UNIX98" to "SUSv2"

malloc.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change "UNIX 98" to "SUSv2"

mktemp.3
    Gleb Fotengauer-Malinovskiy
        Reference mkdtemp(3) in addition to mkstemp(3)
            Mention mkdtemp(3) as another secure alternative to mktemp(3).

            See also https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2898.

mq_receive.3
mq_send.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify discussion of 'timeout'
            In particular, remove the word 'ceiling', which falsely
            suggests that the call might return prematurely.

nl_langinfo.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explicitly describe the return value on success
    Michael Kerrisk
        POSIX specifies that the caller may not modify the returned string
    Michael Kerrisk
        Enhance RETURN VALUE description
            Note some further cases where returned string may be
            invalidated or overwritten.

perror.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reformat CONFORMING to information
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that 'sys_errlist' and 'sys_nerr' are not in POSIX.1

posix_openpt.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reword text regarding systems that don't have posix_openpt()

printf.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        CONFORMING TO: update details for dprintf() and vdprintf()

setlogmask.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove useless statement in CONFORMING TO
            Saying that the description in PSOX.1-2001 is flawed,
            without saying what the fla is, is not helpful.

            GNU C Library commit 1747fcda4902a3b46183d93fb16ed9b436b2608b
            extends the priorities that can be set to the Program Priority
            Register (PPR), with the functions: __ppc_set_ppr_very_low(3)

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

mremap.2
    Eric B Munson  [Michal Hocko]
        Add note about mremap() with locked areas
            When mremap() is used to move or expand a mapping that is locked
            with mlock() or equivalent it will attempt to populate the new
            area.  However, like mmap(MAP_LOCKED), mremap() will not fail if
            the area cannot be populated.  Also like mmap(MAP_LOCKED) this
            might come as a surprise to users and should be noted.
open.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [David Drysdale]
        Remove accidental mention of O_TTY_INIT
            An earlier edit mentioned O_TTY_INIT as a file creation flag.
            That's true, according POSIX, but Linux does not implement
            this flag, so remove mention of it.

pipe.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add splice(2)

prctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reorder options alphabetically
            Employ a pseudo-alphabetical order, ordering options after removal
            of any "PR_", "PR_SET_", or "PR_GET" prefix.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix alphabetical misplacements in ERRORS

ptrace.2
    Tycho Andersen
        Document PTRACE_O_SUSPEND_SECCOMP flag
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that PTRACE_ATTACH cannot be applied to nondumpable processes
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add prctl(2)

reboot.2
    Casper Ti. Vector
        1-argument reboot() is also provided by alternative libc

seccomp.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe use of 'instruction_pointer' data field
    Michael Kerrisk  [Kees Cook]
        Note why all filters in a set are executed even after SECCOMP_RET_KILL

signalfd.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe semantics with respect to SCM_RIGHTS

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add mlock(2)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add userfaultfd()

daemon.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Johannes Stüttgen]
        Note that daemon() is buggy with respect to controlling tty acquisition

dirfd.3
    Jonathan Wakely
        Remove outdated NOTES
            As stated in the SYNOPSIS, since glibc 2.10 this function is also
            declared by the relevant X/Open and POSIX macros.

dlopen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make it more explicit that LD_BIND_NOW overrides RTLD_LAZY
    Michael Kerrisk  [Florian Weimer]
        Correct the pathname used in EXAMPLE
            Quoting Florian:

                This does not work because libm.so can be a linker script:

                       handle = dlopen("libm.so", RTLD_LAZY);

                The proper way to do this is to include <gnu/lib-names.h>
                and use LIBM_SO.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=108821
    Michael Kerrisk
        Include a shell session showing build/run in EXAMPLE
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change arguments to main() to "void" in EXAMPLE

fgetgrent.3
    Zeng Linggang
        ATTRIBUTES: Note function that is not thread-safe

fgetpwent.3
    Zeng Linggang
        ATTRIBUTES: Note function that is not thread-safe

getauxval.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some details for AT_SECURE

getspnam.3
    Zeng Linggang
        ATTRIBUTES: Note functions that are/aren't thread-safe

mallinfo.3
    Zeng Linggang
        ATTRIBUTES: Note function that is not thread-safe

mallopt.3
    Carlos O'Donell
        Document M_ARENA_TEST and M_ARENA_MAX

posix_fallocate.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify text relating to MT-safety
    Carlos O'Donell
        Mention glibc emulation caveats

termios.3
    Olivier TARTROU
        Add missing details on behaviour of PARMRK
            For a serial terminal, with a specific configuration, input bytes
            with value 0377 are passed to the program as two bytes, 0377 0377.

tty_ioctl.4
    Michael Kerrisk  [Peter Hurley]
        Note that TIOCTTYGSTRUCT went away in Linux 2.5.67

core.5
    Ross Zwisler
        Add info about DAX coredump filtering flags
            Kernel 4.4 added two new core dump filtering flags,
            MMF_DUMP_DAX_PRIVATE and MMF_DUMP_DAX_SHARED.

            These flags allow us to explicitly filter DAX mappings.
            This is desirable because DAX mappings, like hugetlb
            mappings, have the potential to be very large.

nsswitch.conf.5
    Nikola Forró
        Add list of files being read when "files" service is used
            This is not mentioned anywhere. Users can assume that the file
            being read is something like /etc/$DATABASE, but that's not
            always the case. It's better to explicitly specify which
            file is read for each respective database.  The list of
            files was acquired from glibc source code.

proc.5
    Heinrich Schuchardt  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Add details for threads-max
            Add detail information for threads-max.
            The checks for minimum and maximum values exist since kernel 4.1.
            https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/3/15/96
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        /proc/sys: Describe whitespace characters
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document 'CapAmb' in /proc/PID/status
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add reference to ptrace(2) for /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope

aio.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Meikun Wang]
        Add missing include file, <fcntl.h>, to example program

mq_overview.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Arto Bendiken]
        Document QSIZE bug that appeared in 3.5 and was fixed in 4.2

path_resolution.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify recursive resolution of symlinks and note limits

pipe.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add splice(2)

rtld-audit.7
    Namhyung Kim
        Fix (typo) error in la_pltenter() description
            s/la_pltenter()/la_pltexit()/

            la_pltenter() is called regardless of the value of
            framesizep but la_pltexit() is called only if la_pltenter()
            returns with non-zero framesizep set.  I spent long time to
            figure out why la_pltexit() is not called at all.

signal.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Michael Hocko]
        Note async-signal-safe functions added by POSIX.1-2008 TC1

tcp.7
    Daniel Borkmann  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Improve paragraphs on tcp_ecn and add tcp_ecn_fallback bullet
            Improve description of tcp_ecn, fix the RFC number and it's
            not a boolean anymore since long time, and add a description
            for tcp_ecn_fallback.

            See also kernel doc under Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt
            on tcp_ecn and tcp_ecn_fallback.

ld.so.8
    Michael Kerrisk
        LD_POINTER_GUARD has been removed in glibc 2.23
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe secure-execution mode
    Michael Kerrisk  [Maria Guseva]
        Replace mentions of set-UID/set-GID programs with secure-execution mode
            Inspired by a patch from Maria Guseva.
    Maria Guseva  [Silvan Jegen]
        LD_DEBUG is effective in secure-execution mode if /etc/suid-debug exists

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

copy_file_range.2
    Anna Schumaker  [Darrick J. Wong, Christoph Hellwig, Michael Kerrisk]
        New page documenting copy_file_range()
            copy_file_range() is a new system call for copying ranges of data
            completely in the kernel.  This gives filesystems an opportunity to
            implement some kind of "copy acceleration", such as reflinks or
            server-side-copy (in the case of NFS).

personality.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        This page has been greatly expanded, to add descriptions of
        personality domains.

fmemopen.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Adhemerval Zanella]
        Significant reworking of this page:
        * Rework discussion of the (obsolete) binary mode
        * Split open_memstream(3) description into a separate page.
        * Note various fmemopen() bugs that were fixed in glibc 2.22
        * Greatly expand description of 'mode' argument
        * Rework description of 'buf' and 'len' arguments
        * Expand discussion of "current position" for fmemopen() stream

ntp_gettime.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        New page describing ntp_gettime(3) and ntp_gettimex(3)

open_memstream.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        New page created by split of fmemopen(3).
        At the same time, add and rework a few details in the text.

posix_spawn.3
    Bill O. Gallmeister, Michael Kerrisk
        New man page documenting posix_spawn(3) and posix_spawnp(3)

readdir.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Florian Weimer]
        Split readdir_r() content into separate page
            As suggested by Florian Weimer:

                It may make sense to move this documentation to a separate
                manual page, specific to readdir_r.  This will keep the
                readdir() documentation nice and crisp.  Most programmers
                will never have to consult all these details.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Near complete restructuring of the page and add some further details
    Michael Kerrisk  [Florian Weimer, Rich Felker, Paul Eggert]
        Add a lot more detail on portable use of the 'd_name' field

readdir_r.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Florian Weimer]
        New page created after split of readdir(3).
    Michael Kerrisk  [Florian Weimer]
        Explain why readdir_r() is deprecated and readdir() is preferred
    Michael Kerrisk  [Florian Weimer]
        Remove misleading code example using pathconf()

Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update FTM requirements (_DEFAULT_SOURCE)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update feature test macro requirements
            Update to use _DEFAULT_SOURCE, and also changes brought by
            glibc commit 266865c0e7b79d4196e2cc393693463f03c90bd8.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Simplify FTM requirements
            Looking at <features.h> (or feature_test_macros(7)), one can
            see that when _XOPEN_SOURCE is defined with the value 700
            (or greater), then _POSIX_C_SOURCE is defined with the value
            200809L (or greater). Therefore, terms in the man pages such as

                _XOPEN_SOURCE\ >=\ 700 || _POSIX_C_SOURCE\ >=\ 200809L

            can be simplified to:

                _POSIX_C_SOURCE\ >=\ 200809L

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Simplify FTM requirements
            Looking at <features.h> (or feature_test_macros(7)), one can
            see that when _XOPEN_SOURCE is defined with the value 600
            (or greater), then _POSIX_C_SOURCE is defined with the value
            200112L (or greater). Therefore, terms in the man pages such as

                _XOPEN_SOURCE\ >=\ 600 || _POSIX_C_SOURCE\ >=\ 200112L

            can be simplified to:

                _POSIX_C_SOURCE\ >=\ 200112L

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Simplify FTM requirements
            _XOPEN_SOURCE implies _POSIX_C_SOURCE >=2, so simplify FTM
            requirements in various pages.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove "or 'cc -std=c99'" from SYNOPSIS
            Under the FTM requirements all of these pages document the
            requirement for _ISOC99_SOURCE. And feature_test_macros(7) now
            documents that "cc -std=c99" produces the same effect as defining
            _ISOC99_SOURCE. So, all of these pages don't additionally need
            to specify "or 'cc -std=c99'" under the FTM requirements
            in the SYNOPSIS. Removing that redundant text also simplifies
            the SYNOPSIS a little.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Simplify FTM requirements
            Looking at <features.h> (or feature_test_macros(7)), one can
            see that when _XOPEN_SOURCE is defined with the value 600
            (or greater), then _POSIX_C_SOURCE is defined with the value
            200112L (or greater). Therefore, terms in the man pages such as

                _XOPEN_SOURCE\ >=\ 600 || _POSIX_C_SOURCE\ >=\ 200112L

            can be simplified to:

                _POSIX_C_SOURCE\ >=\ 200112L

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove references to _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED in SYNOPSIS
            _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED is obsolete (it existed in SUSv1, but not
            subsequent standards). _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500 produces the same
            effects as (_XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED). Modifying
            the SYNOPSIS of various ages that contain:

                _XOPEN_SOURCE\ >=\ 500 ||
                    _XOPEN_SOURCE\ &&\ _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED

            to just:

                _XOPEN_SOURCE\ >=\ 500

            This has the following benefits:

            a) Simplifying the SYNOPSIS by removing ancient
               historical information.

            b) Preventing users from being misled into using
               _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED in new source code.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove mention of the obsolete _POSIX_SOURCE macro from SYNOPSIS
            _POSIX_SOURCE was a POSIX.1-1990 creation that was soon made
            obsolete by _POSIX_C_SOURCE. Retaining mention of it
            in the feature test macro requirements section of the
            SYNOPSIS doesn't contain important information, and may
            mislead readers into actually trying to use this macro.
            A few mentions of it are maintained in a some pages where
            defining _POSIX_SOURCE inhibits some behavior.

Various sockets-related pages
    Michael Kerrisk  [Carlos O'Donell]
        Use consistent argument/variable names for socket addresses and lengths
            As noted by Carlos, there's quite a bit of inconsistency across
            pages. Use 'addr' and 'addrlen' consistently in variables and
            function arguments.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Wording fix: "current file offset" ==> "file offset"
            "File offset" is the preferred POSIX terminology.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Word "descriptor" more precisely
            Use either "file descriptor" or "message queue descriptor".

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: add reference to signal(7) in description of EINTR


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

locale.1
    Marko Myllynen
        Add "locale -c charmap" as an example
            Addresses https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=104511.

localedef.1
    Marko Myllynen
        Add hint on purpose of --no-archive
            Indicate why using --no-archive might be a good idea. The issue
            is that if you create a custom locale with localedef(1) and put
            it to the locale archive then during the next glibc upgrade the
            locale archive is updated as well and your custom locale is gone.)

accept.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: improve description for EBADF

adjtimex.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [John Stultz]
        Various improvements after feedback from John Stultz
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove FTM requirements
            It seems that adjtimex() never needed _BSD_SOURCE (and my
            earlier commit 5918743bc8b02b was simply a blunder).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Split EINVAL error cases
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note treatment of out-of-range buf.offset
    Michael Kerrisk
        Don't refer reader to adjtime(3)
            Probably, it's not wise to suggest adjtime(3) as the more
            portable API. Rather, ntp_adjtime(3) should be used.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Naresh Kamboju]
        Update details of buf.offset EINVAL error
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add ntp_gettime(3)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Improve description of some PPS timex fields
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add ATTRIBUTES section
    William Preston  [Petr Gajdos]
        Update a detail in adjtimex return value description
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note range constraints and clamping for ADJ_FREQUENCY

bdflush.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that glibc support for this system call went away in version 2.23

bind.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Improve description of ENOENT error

bpf.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document close-on-exec semantics
            The close-on-exec file descriptor flag is automatically enabled
            for FDs returned by bpf().

chmod.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify terminology (file mode versus file permission bits)

chown.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: improve EBADF description

clone.2
unshare.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove mention of _BSD_SOURCE and _SVID_SOURCE
            The right way to expose declarations for these Linux-specific
            system calls was always _GNU_SOURCE. Mentioning the historical
            use of _BSD_SOURCE and _SVID_SOURCE just clouds the issue.

connect.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: improve EBADF description

create_module.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Glibc 2.23 removed last vestiges of support for this system call

delete_module.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Glibc 2.23 removed last vestiges of support for this system call

epoll_ctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document ELOOP error for circular monitoring loops

eventfd.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that eventfd info is available in /proc/PID/fdinfo

execve.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Krzysztof Adamski]
        Add EPERM error for capabilities check of capability-dumb binaries
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add reference to ld-linux.so(8)
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add system(3)

fanotify_init.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note kernel version that allowed O_CLOEXEC for event_f_flags

fcntl.2
flock.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add lslocks(8)

fcntl.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jason Vas Dias]
        Rework description of F_SETOWN
            As suggested by Jason, make it clearer that I/O signalling
            requires the use of both F_SETOWN and O_ASYNC. While we're at,
            make a few other cleanups to the text.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove mention of _BSD_SOURCE to get definition of F_SETOWN/F_GETOWN
            This usage went away in glibc 2.20, and the simplest remedy
            is just to omit mention of it.

futex.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        FUTEX_CLOCK_REALTIME can now be used with FUTEX_WAIT

get_kernel_syms.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that glibc does not support this system call

init_module.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Glibc 2.23 removed last vestiges of support for this system call

ioctl_list.2
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Include uapi/linux/wireless.h
            Add the list of wireless IOCTLs.
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Path to sockios.h
            sockios.h is now in include/uapi
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Add reference to netdevice.7
            netdevice.7 describes most of the IOCTLs of sockios.h
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Transfer structure (wireless.h IOCTLs)
            The sole parameter to be passed to the wireless.h IOCTLs is
            of type struct iwreq *.

ioperm.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Alex Henrie]
        ioperm.2: Permissions are inherited across fork(2)
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99911

        NOTES: mention existence of proc/PID/fd and /proc/PID/fdinfo
    Mark Post  [Petr Gajdos]
        O_TMPFILE support is now provided bt Btrfs

    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Equivalence to read()
            Describe the recv(2)-read(2) and the recvfrom(2)-recv(2)
            equivalences for zero-valued arguments.
    Michael Kerrisk
        MSG_WAITALL has no effect for datagram sockets

recv.2
cmsg.3
    Nikola Forró
        Fix type of cmsg_len member of cmsghdr structure
            The type shown for cmsg_len member of cmsghdr structure is socklen_t,
            but the actual type used by glibc and the kernel is size_t.
            The information was obtained from glibc source code:
            http://bit.ly/21m1RMp
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that cmsg_len is typed as socklen_t in POSIX.1


sched_setaffinity.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Florian Weimer, Florian Weimer]
        Warn that CPU_ALLOC() may allocate a slightly CPU set than requested
    Michael Kerrisk  [Florian Weimer]
        Add reference to CPU_ALLOC(3)

sched_setattr.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Akihiro Suda]
        EPERM depends on affinity mask of target thread, not calling thread

select.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Josh Triplett]
        Document spurious EAGAIN error that can occur on other systems
            Light reworking of text proposed by Josh Triplett.
    Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos
        Mention the 'fd_set' size limitation early and refer to poll(2)
            Change this because of the serious limitation of select()
            imposing a limit on the range of file descriptors that can
            be monitored. This is currently mentioned too late in the
            documentation (in the NOTES section). The man page should
            warn early and refer to poll(2) as soon as possible.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add details on the glibc fixed-size fd_set limitation
            No modern application should use select() on Linux.

select_tut.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Some readability fixes to example program
    Michael Kerrisk
        Better variable names in example program
    Michael Kerrisk
        Simplify 'if' logic in example program

        Correct/simplify FTM requirements for BSD setpgrp() and getpgrp()

signalfd.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that signalfd info is available in /proc/PID/fdinfo

sigprocmask.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mike Frysinger]
        Explicitly refer the reader to sigsetops(3)
            This man page did not make it obvious which functions
            should be used for manipulating signals sets, nor where
            those functions were documented.

socketpair.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Eric Blake]
        Note treatment of 'sv' on error

splice.2
    Askar Safin
        Improve description of 0 return value.
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=90911

statfs.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jakub Wilk]
        Use consistent case for hex constants

sync.2
    Christoph Hellwig
        Clarify description and document the Linux data integrity guarantees

syscall.2
    Mike Frysinger
        Add more architectures and improve error documentation
            Move the error register documentation into the main table rather
            than listing them in sentences after the fact.

            Add sparc error return details.

            Add details for alpha/arc/m68k/microblaze/nios2/powerpc/superh/
            tile/xtensa.

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add copy_file_range(2)

times.2
    Kondo, Naoya
        Fix an incorrect description in NOTES
            The text has an incorrect description in NOTES, it says
            that (2^32/HZ) - 300 is about 429 million. It is correct
            only if HZ=10 which does not look common today. So just
            removing "(i.e., about 429 million)" is good enough.

truncate.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add truncate(1)

uselib.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention CONFIG_USELIB
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that glibc does not support this (obsolete) system call

wait.2
wait4.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rename the "status" argument to "wstatus"
            The fact that exit(3)/_exit(2) has an argument called
            "status" and the same name is used in the arguments to the
            wait*() calls can a little too easily lead the user into
            thinking that the two arguments hold the same information,
            when of course they don't. So, use a different name
            for the argument of the wait*() functions, to reduce
            the chances of such confusion.

backtrace.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Martin Gebert]
        Small fixes to example program

clearenv.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Matt Zimmerman]
        Clarify the use and effect of clearenv()

fopen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add open_memstream(3)

fts.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        BUGS: glibc-2.23 now has LFS support for the fts functions

gamma.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Alan Cox]
        gamma() was documented in SVID 2

getaddrinfo.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Andreas Schwab, Orion Poplawski]
        Update FTM requirements for glibc 2.22
            Since glibc 2.22 getaddrinfo() etc. are only declared for
            POSIX.1-2001 or later.

    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add pwd(1)

opendir.3
    Michael Kerrisk

    Michael Kerrisk
        Suggest use of strerror(3) in place of deprecated 'sys_errlist'

posix_fallocate.3
    Jérémie Galarneau
        ERRORS: add EINTR
            The glibc implementation of posix_fallocate(), which calls
            fallocate(), may be interrupted. The fallocate() emulation
            also makes use of pread()/pwrite(), which may also be
            interrupted.

posix_memalign.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Eric Blake]
        Note posix_memalign()'s treatment of 'memptr' on error

    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add CPU_SET(3)

queue.3
    Dr. Tobias Quathamer
        Remove double CONFORMING TO section

rcmd.3
    Nikola Forró
        Add missing condition concerning .rhosts file
            The list of conditions determining if iruserok() and ruserok()
            functions automatically fail is incomplete. According to glibc
            source code, the functions also fail if the .rhosts file
            is hard linked anywhere.

setbuf.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add stdbuf(1)

setjmp.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite and merge longjmp()/siglongjmp() discussion into this page
            The discussion of nonlocal gotos is much easier to read if
            setjmp() and longjmp() are discussed in the same page. While
            we're at it, rework almost the entire text and add several
            more details.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note the interactions of longjmp() and non-async-signal-safe functions
            POSIX.1-2008 TC2 adds explicit text on this point.
            See http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=516#c1195
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain why nonlocal gotos make code harder to maintain

strlen.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Alan Aversa]

    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add tty(1)
    Michael Kerrisk  [Peter Hurley]
        Further improvements to recent tweaks of canonical mode 4096 char limit

timegm.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Stephen Hurd, Mats Wichmann]
        Remove sample implementation of timegm()
            Stephen and Mats both question the wisdom of showing a portable
            *non-thread-safe* implementation of timegm(), and I find it
            hard to disagree. So, remove this code.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103701
    Michael Kerrisk
        Expand DESCRIPTION a little

            effects as defining  _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that man pages don't mention _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED
            As per previous commit, mention of _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED

    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add cgroups(7)

ioctl_fat.2
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Use %04x to print volume ID

makedev.3
    Mike Frysinger
        Use <sys/sysmacros.h> in SYNOPSIS
            Defining these functions via <sys/types.h> causes problems for
            some folk. As noted by Zack Wein:

                libstdc++ force-enables _GNU_SOURCE, which means people
                writing in C++ _can't_ avoid these nonstandard macros by
                using a strict conformance mode.

            Since glibc has basically always used <sys/sysmacros.h>,
            update the docs to have people include that instead.
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: mention that <sys/types.h> may also define these macros

popen.3
    Nikola Forró
        RETURN VALUE: describe successful case
            Reference:
            http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/popen.html

    Michael Kerrisk  [Ed Avis]
        Improve a detail in RETURN VALUE

core.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document /proc/sys/kernel/core_pipe_limit

locale.5
    Marko Myllynen
        Adjust LC_IDENTIFICATION / abbreviation
            Tiny tweak to locale.5 based on ISO/IEC TR 14652:

            http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/SC22/WG20/docs/n972-14652ft.pdf
    Marko Myllynen
        Update LC_ADDRESS after glibc change
            This patch updates locale.5 to match the recent glibc change
            in commit a837257199ffab76237385b830cc7b6179fc2f18
    Marko Myllynen
        Complete LC_COLLATE
            Here's the first attempt to (almost) complete the locale.5 manual
            page by documenting all (but perhaps one) of the missing
            LC_COLLATE keywords.
    Mike Frysinger
        country_car: Add a better description


nsswitch.conf.5
    Marko Myllynen
        Document group merging
            Document the recently merged glibc group merge support.

        SEE ALSO: add cgroups(7)

ip.7
    Benjamin Poirier
        Fix incorrect sockopt name
            "IP_LEAVE_GROUP" does not exist. It was perhaps a confusion with
            MCAST_LEAVE_GROUP. Change the text to IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP which has
            the same function as MCAST_LEAVE_GROUP and is documented in the
            ip.7 man page.

            Reference:
            Linux kernel net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c do_ip_setsockopt()

            VDSO support was added from kernel 4.4 onwards.

            See https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/arch/mips/vdso
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rasmus Villemoes]
        The __kernel_clock_* interfaces don't support *_COARSE clocks on PowerPC

ld.so.8
    Michael Kerrisk  [Alon Bar-Lev]
        Document use of $ORIGIN, $LIB, and $PLATFORM in environment variables
            These strings are meaningful in LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LD_PRELOAD.

    Michael Kerrisk
        Add more detail on the output of ldd

localedef.1
    Marko Myllynen
        Drop --old-style description
            The glibc upstream decided to drop localedef(1) --old-style
            option [1] altogether, I think we can do the same with
            localedef(1), the option hasn't done anything in over 16
            years and I doubt anyone uses it.

add_key.2
    Mitch Walker
        Empty payloads are not allowed in user-defined keys

chroot.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add pivot_root(2)

futex.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Correct an ENOSYS error description
            Since Linux 4.5, FUTEX_CLOCK_REALTIME is allowed with FUTEX_WAIT.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Darren Hart]
        Remove crufty text about FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET interpretation of timeout
            Since Linux 4.5, FUTEX_WAIT also understands
            FUTEX_CLOCK_REALTIME.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Thomas Gleixner]
        Explain how to get equivalent of FUTEX_WAIT with an absolute timeout
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe FUTEX_BITSET_MATCH_ANY

            equivalences.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that at least one bit must be set in mask for BITSET operations
            At least one bit must be set in the 'val3' mask supplied for the
            FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET and FUTEX_WAKE_BITSET operations.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Thomas Gleixner, Darren Hart]
        Fix descriptions of various timeouts
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify clock default and choices for FUTEX_WAIT

getitimer.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Substantial rewrites to various parts of the page
    Michael Kerrisk  [Tom Callaway]
        Change license to note that page may be modified
            The page as originally written carried text that said the page may
            be freely distributed but made no statement about modification.
            In the 20+ years since it was first written, the page has in fact
            seen repeated, sometimes substantial, modifications, and only a
            small portion of the original text remains. One could I suppose
            rewrite the last few pieces that remain from the original,
            but as the largest contributor to the pages existing text,
            I'm just going to relicense it to explicitly note that
            modification is permitted. (I presume the failure by the
            original author to grant permission to modify was simply an
            oversight; certainly, the large number of people who have
            changed the page have taken that to be the case.)

            See also https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=118311

get_mempolicy.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jörn Engel]
        Correct rounding to 'maxnodes' (bits, not bytes)
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jörn Engel]
        Fix prototype for get_mempolicy()
            In numaif.h, 'addr' is typed as 'void *'

getpriority.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make discussion of RLIMIT_NICE more prominent
            The discussion of RLIMIT_NICE was hidden under the EPERM error,
            where it was difficult to find. Place some relevant text in
            DESCRIPTION.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that getpriority()/setpriority deal with same attribute as nice(2)
    Michael Kerrisk  [Robin Kuzmin]
        Clarify equivalence between lower nice value and higher priority

get_robust_list.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        get_robust_list() is governed by PTRACE_MODE_READ_REALCREDS

ioctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add ioctl_fideduperange(2) and ioctl_ficlonerange(2)

        SEE ALSO: add oprofile(1)

mmap.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rahul Bedarkar]
        EXAMPLE: for completeness, add munmap() and close() calls

mount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Restructure discussion of 'mountflags' into functional groups
            The existing text makes no differentiation between different
            "classes" of mount flags. However, certain flags such as
            MS_REMOUNT, MS_BIND, MS_MOVE, etc. determine the general
            type of operation that mount() performs. Furthermore, the
            choice of which class of operation to perform is performed in
            a certain order, and that order is significant if multiple
            flags are specified. Restructure and extend the text to
            reflect these details.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Relocate text on multimounting and mount stacking to NOTES
            The text was somewhat out of place in its previous location;
            NOTES is a better location.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove version numbers attached to flags that are modifiable on remount
            This information was simply bogus. Mea culpa.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer reader to mount_namespaces(7) for details on propagation types
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: s/namespaces(7)/mount_namespaces(7)/
    Omar Sandoval
        MS_BIND still ignores mountflags
            This is clear from the do_mount() function in the kernel as of v4.6.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note the default treatment of ATIME flags during MS_REMOUNT
            The behavior changed in Linux 3.17.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that MS_MOVE ignores remaining bits in 'mountflags'
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note kernel version that added MS_MOVE
    Michael Kerrisk
        MS_NOSUID also disables file capabilities
    Michael Kerrisk
        Relocate/demote/rework text on MS_MGC_VAL
            The use of this constant has not been needed for 15 years now.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that 'source' and 'target' are pathnames, and can refer to files
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update example list of filesystem types
            Put more modern examples in; remove many older examples.
    Michael Kerrisk
        MS_LAZYTIME and MS_RELATIME can be changed on remount
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explicitly note that MS_DIRSYNC setting cannot be changed on remount
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move text describing 'data' argument higher up in page
            In preparation for other reworking.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since Linux 2.6.26, bind mounts can be made read-only

open.2
    Eric Biggers
        Refer to correct functions in description of O_TMPFILE

pciconfig_read.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Tom Callaway]
        Change license to note that page may be modified
            Niki Rahimi, the author of this page, has agreed that it's okay
            to change the license to note that the page can be modified.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=118311

perf_event_open.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        If pid > 0, the operation is governed by PTRACE_MODE_READ_REALCREDS
    Jann Horn
        Document new perf_event_paranoid default
    Keno Fischer  [Vince Weaver]
        Add a note that dyn_size is omitted if size == 0
            The perf_output_sample_ustack in kernel/events/core.c only writes
            a single 64 bit word if it can't dump the user registers. From the
            current version of the man page, I would have expected two 64 bit
            words (one for size, one for dyn_size). Change the man page to
            make this behavior explicit.

prctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Some wording improvements in timer slack description
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer reader to discussion of /proc/[pid]/timerslack_ns
            Under discussion of PR_SET_TIMERSLACK, refer the reader to
            the /proc/[pid]/timerslack_ns file, documented in proc(5).

            Reframe the discussion in terms of PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH checks,
            and make a few other minor tweaks and additions.
    Michael Kerrisk, Jann Horn
        Note that user namespaces can be used to bypass Yama protections
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that PTRACE_SEIZE is subject to a ptrace access mode check
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rephrase PTRACE_ATTACH permissions in terms of ptrace access mode check

quotactl.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jacob Willoughby]
        'dqb_curspace' is in bytes, not blocks
            This error appears to have been injected into glibc
            when copying some headers from BSD.

            See https://bugs.debian.org/825548

recv.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Tom Gundersen]

            See sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/i386/setfsuid.c in glibc-2.2.1.
            (This code is not present in modern glibc anymore.)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move glibc wrapper notes to "C library/kernel differences" subsection

utimensat.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rob Landley]
        Note that the glibc wrapper disallows pathname==NULL

wait.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since Linux 4.7, __WALL is implied if child being ptraced
    Michael Kerrisk
        waitid() now (since Linux 4.7) also supports __WNOTHREAD/__WCLONE/__WALL

assert.3
    Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos
        Improved description
            Removed text referring to text not being helpful to users. Provide
            the error text instead to allow the reader to determine whether it
            is helpful.  Recommend against using NDEBUG for programs to
            exhibit deterministic behavior.  Moved description ahead of
            recommendations.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify details of message printed by assert()

    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add a64l(3)

strxfrm.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Florian Weimer]
        Remove NOTES section
            strxfrm() and strncpy() are not precisely equivalent in the
            POSIX locale, so this NOTES section was not really correct.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=104221

            references to it. The patch below removes them or converts to refs
            to console_ioctl(4) where appropriate.

            governed by a PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS ptrace access mode check.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Nowadays, file changes in /proc/PID/mounts are notified differently
            Exceptional condition for select(), (E)POLLPRI for (e)poll
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove /proc/PID/mountstats description
            This is a duplicate of information in proc(5).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer to new mount_namespaces(7) for information on mount namespaces

netlink.7
    Andrey Vagin
        Describe netlink socket options
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework version information
            (No changes in technical details.)

pid_namespaces.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add namespaces(7)

unix.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move discussion on pathname socket permissions to DESCRIPTION
    Michael Kerrisk
        Expand discussion of socket permissions
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix statement about permissions needed to connect to a UNIX domain socket
            Read permission is not required (verified by experiment).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify ownership and permissions assigned during socket creation
    Michael Kerrisk  [Carsten Grohmann]
        Update text on socket permissions on other systems
            At least some of the modern BSDs seem to check for write
            permission on a socket. (I tested OpenBSD 5.9.) On Solaris 10,
            some light testing suggested that write permission is still
            not checked on that system.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that umask / permissions have no effect for abstract sockets
    W. Trevor King
        Fix example code: 'ret' check after accept populates 'data_socket'
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move some abstract socket details to a separate subsection
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that abstract sockets automatically disappear when FDs are closed

user_namespaces.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Michał Zegan]
        Clarify meaning of privilege in a user namespace
            Having privilege in a user NS only allows privileged
            operations on resources governed by that user NS. Many
            privileged operations relate to resources that have no
            association with any namespace type, and only processes
            with privilege in the initial user NS can perform those
            operations.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=120671
    Michael Kerrisk  [Michał Zegan]
        List the mount operations permitted by CAP_SYS_ADMIN
            List the mount operations permitted by CAP_SYS_ADMIN in a
            noninitial userns.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=120671
    Michael Kerrisk  [Michał Zegan]
        CAP_SYS_ADMIN allows mounting cgroup filesystems
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=120671
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify details of CAP_SYS_ADMIN and cgroup v1 mounts
            With respect to cgroups version 1, CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the user
            namespace allows only *named* hierarchies to be mounted (and
            not hierarchies that have a controller).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify CAP_SYS_ADMIN details for mounting FS_USERNS_MOUNT filesystems
    Michael Kerrisk
        Correct user namespace rules for mounting /proc
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe a concrete example of capability checking
            Add a concrete example of how the kernel checks capabilities in
            an associated user namespace when a process attempts a privileged
            operation.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Correct kernel version where XFS added support for user namespaces
            Linux 3.12, not 3.11.

utf-8.7:
    Shawn Landden
        Include RFC 3629 and clarify endianness which is left ambiguous
            The endianness is suggested by the order the bytes are displayed,
            but the text is ambiguous.

Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix section ordering
            Various pages had sections in an order different from
            that prescribed in man-pages(7).

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mike Frysinger]
        Consistently use /proc/[pid] (not /proc/PID)

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix order of SEE ALSO entries
            Entries should be ordered first by section, and then alphabetically
            within the section.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Order ERRORS alphabetically

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove section number from page self reference
            Fix places where pages refer to the function that they describe
            and include a section number in that reference. Such references
            cause some HTML-rendering tools to create self-references in the
            page.

A few pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Eliminate groff "cannot adjust line" warnings


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

pldd.1
    Michael Kerrisk  [Carlos O'Donell]
        Note gdb(1) command that can be used as a replacement for pldd
            Taken from Carlos O'Donnell's suggestion in
            https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=18035#c2
    Michael Kerrisk
        BUGS: pldd has not worked since glibc 2.19

accept.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention epoll(7) alongside poll()/select()
    Michael Kerrisk
        Demote discussion of DECNet to NOTES
            DECNet ceased to be important long ago...

adjtimex.2
    Nikola Forró
        Fix kernel version references

chroot.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note user namespace requirements for CAP_SYS_CHROOT

clone.2
    Keno Fischer  [Josh Triplett]
        Adjust syscall prototype and expand CLONE_SETTLS description
    Michael Kerrisk  [Josh Triplett, Josh Triplett]
        Document raw syscall interfaces on various other architectures
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change types for 'ptid' and 'ctid' in syscall prototypes
            These types changed from 'void *' to 'int *' back in Linux 3.8.
    Michael Kerrisk
        EINVAL is generated by glibc wrapper for NULL 'fn' or 'child_stack'
            Clarify that this error is produced by the wrapper function, not
            the underlying system call. In particular, the point is that the
            raw system call can accommodate a NULL pointer for 'child_stack'.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Elliott Hughes]
        Make the implications of CLONE_FILES more explicit
            If CLONE_FILES is not set, the duplicated FDs nevertheless share
            file offset and status flags via the open file description.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention kcmp() under notes

close.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add mention of the close-on-exec flag

    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention use of 'environ' to access environment list
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that real UID, real GID, and supplementary GIDs are unchanged

fanotify_init.2
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Update BUGS information

fcntl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note an important detail of F_SETOWN permission rules for signals
            F_SETOWN records the caller's credentials at the time of
            the fcntl() call, and it is these saved credentials that
            are used for subsequent permission checks.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make the description of the effect of close-on-exec a little clearer
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that F_GETFD and F_GETFL return flags via the function result

fork.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        PID of new process also does not match any existing session ID

fsync.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add pwritev(2)
            Since Linux 4.7, pwritev() has flags related to I/O
            integrity completion.

        Note user namespace requirements for CAP_SYS_ADMIN

getgroups.2
    Michael Kerrisk

    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework description to be somewhat clearer
    Michael Kerrisk
        Correct the definition of "session ID"

getunwind.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Simplify text referring to vdso(7)
            The detail given here is redundant, since this info is also
            in vdso(7).

kcmp.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add an example program

kill.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note the user namespace requirement for CAP_KILL

killpg.2
    Michael Kerrisk

    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: kcmp() can be used to test if two FDs refer to the same OFD
    Michael Kerrisk
        F2FS support for O_TMPFILE was added in Linux 3.16
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify the rules about how the group ID of a new file is determined

prctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer to proc(5) for effects of dumpability on ownership of /proc/PID/*
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: Add EACCES error for PR_SET_SECCOMP-SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER
    Michael Kerrisk
        Simplify list of cases where "dumpable" attribute is reset
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note user namespace requirements for PR_CAPBSET_DROP CAP_SETPCAP

readlink.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Ursache Vladimir]
        Make example program handle links that report a size of zero
            Some "magic" symlinks created by the kernel (e.g., those under
            /proc and /sys) report 'st_size' as zero. Modify the example
            program to handle that possibility.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Emphasize that truncation of returned buffer generates no error

readv.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Christoph Hellwig]
        Clarify that RWF_DSYNC and RWF_SYNC apply only to data being written
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add preadv2() and pwritev2() to NAME line

reboot.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note user namespace requirements around CAP_SYS_BOOT

rename.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Tim Savannah]
        Clarify that ERRORS may cause rename to fail (not to be nonatomic)

sched_setaffinity.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note user namespace requirements for CAP_SYS_NICE

seccomp.2

setsid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Relocate some text on sessions and sessions leaders

    Keno Fischer
        Expand/clarify libc/kernel sigset_t difference

stat.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Ursache Vladimir, Mats Wichmann]
        Improve discussion of 'st_size' for /proc and /sys files
    Michael Kerrisk
        _BSD_SOURCE and _SVID_SOURCE no longer expose nanosecond timestamps

umask.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Provide a rationale for the existence of /proc/PID/status 'Umask' field

wait.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove erroneous statement that waitpid() is implemented via wait4()
            There is a fallback to wait4(), but only if the kernel does
            not provide a waitpid() system call.

bindresvport.3
rcmd.3
ip.7
    Michael Kerrisk

        Point to umask(2) for a thread-safe way to discover process's umask

mkstemp.3
    Quentin Rameau
        Fix _POSIX_C_SOURCE value for mkstemp()
            The correct _POSIX_C_SOURCE value has always been 200809L,
            not 200112L.

pthread_join.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mats Wichmann]
        Note that the caller might do clean up after joining with a thread

            See https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=741360

core.5
    Mike Frysinger  [Michael Kerrisk]
       Add more details for output paths and the crash handler
            People sometimes assume that the crash handler runs in the same
            context as the crashing process.  They would be incorrect :).

proc.5
    Mike Frysinger
        Clarify the root symlink and mount namespaces
            If the target process is in a different mount namespace, the root
            symlink actually shows that view of the filesystem.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mike Frysinger]
        Expand discussion of /proc/[pid]/root
            Add a shell example showing that /proc/[pid]/root is more
            than a symlink. Based on an example provided by Mike Frysinger
            in an earlier commit message.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain rules determining ownership of /proc/PID/* files
            Describe the effect of the "dumpable" attribute on ownership
            of /proc/PID files.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note effect of 'suid_dumpable' on ownership of /proc/PID files
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer to ptrace(2) for info on effect of suid_dumpable on ptraceability
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add reference to core(5) in discussion of 'suid_dumpable'
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that 'suid_dumpable' mode 1 is insecure

        Document /proc/meminfo '+ShmemHugePages' and 'ShmemPmdMapped' fields
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document /proc/PID/status 'RssAnon', 'RssFile', and 'RssShmem' fields
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document /proc/PID/status 'HugetlbPages' field
    Michael Kerrisk  [Zefram]
        Clarify that /proc/PID/statm 'shared' field counts *resident* pages
            See https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=741360
    Michael Kerrisk

packet.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify user namespace requirements for CAP_NET_RAW

pipe.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Patrick McLean]
        Document FIONREAD

raw.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify user namespace requirements for CAP_NET_RAW
            Also remove mention of UID 0 as a method or creating
            a raw socket. As far as I can tell from reading the
            kernel source (net/ipv4/af_inet.c), this is not true.

socket.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SIOCSPGRP: refer to fcntl(2) F_SETOWN for correct permission rules
            The permission rules described for SIOCCPGRP are wrong. Rather
            than repeat the rules here, just refer the reader to fcntl(2),
            where the rules are described for F_SETOWN.

unix.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Laurent Georget, Ivan Kharpalev]
        Remove mention of recvmsg() from discussion of EPIPE error
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137351

ld.so.8
    Michael Kerrisk
        Expand description of LD_DEBUG
            Provide a list of the categories, and note that multiple
            categories can be specified.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add glibc version for LD_USE_LOAD_BIAS
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify text describing whether secure-mode programs preload libraries
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove discussion of environment variables understood by libc5
            libc5 disappeared long ago, so cease cluttering up this page
            with those ancient details. Thus, remove discussion of the
            following environment variables: LD_AOUT_LIBRARY_PATH,
            LD_AOUT_PRELOAD, LD_KEEPDIR, LD_NOWARN, and LDD_ARGV0.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove text with ancient libc4 and Linux libc details
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove mention of "ELF only"
            Drawing a distinction between ELF-only features versus a,out
            ceased to be relevant long ago, so cluttering the page
            with "ELF-only" serves no purpose.

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

pkey_alloc.2
    Dave Hansen  [Michael Kerrisk]
        New page documenting pkey_alloc(2) and pkey_free(2)

pthread_getattr_default_np.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        New page documenting pthread_getattr_default_np(3) and pthread_setattr_default_np(3)

strfromd.3
    Wainer dos Santos Moschetta
        New page documenting strfromd(3), strfromf(3), and strfroml(3)
            The ISO/IEC TS 18661-1 specifies the strfrom() class
            of functions that convert a float-point value to string.

fuse.4
    Keno Fischer  [Michael Kerrisk]
        New page describing /dev/fuse
            This is my writeup of a basic description of /dev/fuse after
            playing with it for a few hours today. It is of course woefully
            incomplete, and since I neither have a use case nor am working
            on this code, I will not be in a position to expand it in the
            near future. However, I'm hoping this could still serve as a
            handy reference for others looking at this interface.

            [mtk: Notwithstanding the incompleteness of this page,
            it's a good base for future extension.]

tmpfs.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        New page documenting the tmpfs filesystem

pkeys.7
    Dave Hansen  [Michael Kerrisk]
        New page with overview of Memory Protection Keys

random.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Theodore Ts'o, Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos, Laurent Georget]
        New page providing an overview of interfaces for obtaining randomness
            Contains material extracted from getrandom(2) and random(4),
            as well as new material.

sock_diag.7
    Pavel Emelyanov, Dmitry V. Levin
        New page documenting NETLINK_SOCK_DIAG interface

close.2
getpriority.2
nice.2
timer_create.2

    Eugene Syromyatnikov
        Document PR_SET_FP_MODE and PR_GET_FP_MODE

perf_event_open.2
    Vince Weaver
        PERF_RECORD_SWITCH support
            Linux 4.3 introduced two new record types for recording context
            switches: PERF_RECORD_SWITCH and PERF_RECORD_SWITCH_CPU_WIDE.
    Vince Weaver
        Add PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_CALL branch sample type
    Vince Weaver
        PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_IND_JUMP branch_sample_type
            Linux 4.2 added a new branch_sample_type: PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_IND_JUMP
    Vince Weaver
        Document PERF_RECORD_MISC_PROC_MAP_PARSE_TIMEOUT
    Vince Weaver
        Document sample_max_stack and /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_max_stack
            Linux 4.8 added a new sample_max_stack parameter, as well as
            /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_max_stack which limits it and a new
            EOVERFLOW error return.
    Dave Hansen
        PERF_RECORD_LOST_SAMPLES record type
            Linux 4.2 added a new record type: PERF_RECORD_LOST_SAMPLES
            It is generated when hardware samples (currently only Intel PEBS)
            are lost.

sched.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mike Galbraith]
        Document the autogroup feature
            Includes documenting autogroup nice value
    Michael Kerrisk
        Autogrouping breaks traditional semantics of nice in many cases
            When autogrouping is enabled (the default in many distros)
            there are many traditional use cases where the nice value
            ceases to have any effect.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add a subsection on nice value and group scheduling

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

accept.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove editorializing comments about 'socklen_t'
    Michael Kerrisk
        Simplify the discussion of 'socklen_t'
            We don't really need to list the old OSes in this discussion.

adjtimex.2
clock_getres.2
gettimeofday.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add hwclock(8)

bind.2
connect.2
getpeername.2
getsockname.2
getsockopt.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Replace discussion of 'socklen_t' with reference to accept(2)
            The discussion of 'socklen_t' editorializes and is repeated
            across several pages. Replace it with a reference to accept(2),
            where some details about this type are provided.

chmod.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add chmod(1)

chown.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add chgrp(1) and chown(1)

chroot.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add chroot(1)

clone.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        The CLONE_*_SETTID operations store TID before return to user space
            CLONE_PARENT_SETTID and CLONE_CHILD_SETTID store the new
            TID before clone() returns to user space

close.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Daniel Wagner]
        Rework and greatly extend discussion of error handling
            Further clarify that an error return should be used only
            for diagnostic or remedial purposes.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Other UNIX implementations also close the FD, even if reporting an error
            Looking at some historical source code suggests
            that the "close() always closes regardless of error return"
            behavior has a long history, predating even POSIX.1-1990.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that future POSIX plans to require that the FD is closed on error
            See http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=529#c1200.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify the variation in EINTR behavior per POSIX and other systems

fallocate.2
    Darrick J. Wong
        Document behavior with shared blocks
            Note that FALLOC_FL_UNSHARE may use CoW to unshare blocks to
            guarantee that a disk write won't fail with ENOSPC.

fanotify_mark.2
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Mention FAN_Q_OVERFLOW
            To receive overflow events it is necessary to set this bit
            in fanotify_mark().

fcntl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        F_GETPIPE_SZ allocates next power-of-2 multiple of requested size
            Add some detail about current implementation, since this helps
            the user understand the effect of the user pipe limits added in
            Linux 4.5 (described in pipe(7)).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add EPERM that occurs for F_SETPIPE_SZ when user pipe limit is reached

fideduperange.2
    Darrick J. Wong  [Omar Sandoval]
        Fix the discussion of maximum sizes
            Fix the discussion of the limitations on the dest_count and
            src_length parameters to the fideduperange ioctl() to reflect
            what's actually in the kernel.

fsync.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add fileno(3)
            fileno(3) is useful if one is combining fflush(3)/fclose(3)
            and fsync(2).
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add fflush(3)

getgroups.2
    Andrew Clayton
        FTM requirements fix for setgroups(2)

gethostname.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add hostname(1)

get_mempolicy.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that 'addr' must be NULL when 'flags' is 0

getpriority.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Warn that autogrouping voids the effect of 'nice' in many cases
            Refer the reader to sched(7) for the details.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Expand discussion of getpriority() return value
    Michael Kerrisk
        The nice value supplied to setpriority() is clamped
            Note that the nice value supplied to setpriority() is clamped
            to the permitted range.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Improve description of setpriority() return value

getpriority.2
sched.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move nice value details from getpriority(2) to sched(7)
            Centralizing these details in sched(7) is more logical.

getrandom.2
random.4
    Michael Kerrisk
        Consolidate and improve discussion on usage of randomness
            Currently, recommendations on how to consume randomness are
            spread across both getrandom(2) and random(4) and the general
            opinion seems to be that the text in getrandom(2) does a
            somewhat better job. Consolidate the discussion to a single
            page (getrandom(2)) and address some of the concerns
            expressed about the existing text in random(4).
            [Some of this text ultimately made its way into the new
            random(7) page.]

getrandom.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove material incorporated into random(7)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note advantages of fact that getrandom() doesn't use file descriptors
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that getrandom() is not "reading" from /dev/{random,urandom}

getrlimit.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer to sched(7) in discussion of RLIMIT_RTPRIO and RLIMIT_RTTIME
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe the range of the RLIMIT_NICE limit
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer to sched(7) in the discussion of RLIMIT_NICE
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add credentials(7)

ioctl_ficlonerange.2
ioctl_fideduperange.2
    Darrick J. Wong
        Clarify the behavior of the FIDEDUPERANGE ioctl

kill.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add kill(1)

mbind.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Christoph Lameter]
        Memory policy is a per-thread attribute, not a per-process attribute

mbind.2
set_mempolicy.2
    Piotr Kwapulinski  [Christoph Lameter, Michael Kerrisk]
        Add MPOL_LOCAL NUMA memory policy documentation

mount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add mountpoint(1)

mprotect.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        CONFORMING TO: note that pkey_mprotect() is Linux-specific

nice.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Warn that autogrouping voids the effect of 'nice' in many cases
    Michael Kerrisk
        CONFORMING TO: Remove an ancient SVr4 detail on errno values
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework discussion of nice() return value and standards conformance
            Make the text a little clearer. In particular, clarify that the
            raw system call (still) returns 0 on success.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify the range of the nice value, and note that it is clamped
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add mention of RLIMIT_NICE
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move discussion of handling the -1 success return to RETURN VALUE
            This detail was rather hidden in NOTES. Also, rework the text
            a little.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that nice() changes the nice value of the calling *thread*
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add "C library/kernel differences" subsection heading
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add reference to sched(7) for further details on the nice value

seccomp.2
    Jann Horn
        Document changed interaction with ptrace
            Before kernel 4.8, the seccomp check will not be run again
            after the tracer is notified. Fixed in kernel 4.9.
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: mention ptrace(PTRACE_SECCOMP_GET_FILTER) to dump seccomp filters

            of autogrouping.

sigaction.2
    Dave Hansen
        Further documentation of SEGV_PKUERR

signalfd.2

        Add reference to new random(7) page
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework formatting of /proc interfaces
            Make the information easier to parse by formatting the file
            descriptions as hanging lists. No significant content changes.
    Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos  [Laurent Georget]
        Provide a more accurate description of /dev/urandom
            This documents the "property" of /dev/urandom of being able to
            serve numbers prior to pool being initialized, and removes any
            suggested usages of /dev/random which are disputable
            (i.e., one-time pad).  Document the fact /dev/random is only
            suitable for applications which can afford indeterminate delays
            since very few applications can do so.  Smooth the alarming
            language about a theoretical attack, and mention that its
            security depends on the cryptographic primitives used by the
            kernel, as well as the total entropy gathered.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Laurent Georget, Theodore Ts'o]
        Improve discussion of /dev/urandom, blocking reads, and signals
            The text currently states that O_NONBLOCK has no effect for
            /dev/urandom, which is true.  It also says that reads from
            /dev/urandom are nonblocking.  This is at the least confusing.
            If one attempts large reads (say 10MB) from /dev/urandom
            there is an appreciable delay, and interruption by a signal
            handler will result in a short read. Amend the text to
            reflect this.

elf.5
    Mike Frysinger
        Add subsection headers at major points
            The current pages dumps all the content into one big DESCRIPTION
            with no real visual break up between logically independent
            sections.  Add some subsection headers to make it easier to
            read and scan.
    Mike Frysinger
        Document notes
            Document the Elf{32,64}_Nhdr structure, the sections/segments that
            contain notes, and how to interpret them.  I've been lazy and only
            included the GNU extensions here, especially as others are not
            defined in the elf.h header file as shipped by glibc.

    Michael Kerrisk, Eugene Syromyatnikov  [David Howells, Mat Martineau]
         A vast number of additions and improvements
             The page has gone from somewhat over 100 lines to well over

process-keyring.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        New page (written by David Howells) adopted from keyutils
            Since this page documents kernel-user-space interfaces,

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=25292

thread-keyring.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        New page (written by David Howells) adopted from keyutils

    Michael Kerrisk
        Various rewordings and additions


Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

        ERRORS: add EPERM error for immutable/append-only file

chown.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: add EPERM error for immutable/append-only file

        Note POSIX.1 requirements re relative time services and CLOCK_REALTIME

clone.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        clone() does not execute fork handlers

execve.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework text describing when effective IDs aren't transformed by execve()
    Michael Kerrisk
        File capabilities can be ignored for the same reasons as set-UID/set-GID
    Michael Kerrisk
        The 'no_new_privs' bit inhibits transformations of the effective IDs

fork.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        cgroup PIDs controller may also be trigger for EAGAIN error

fsync.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add posix_fadvise(2)

getrandom.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove getentropy(3) details and defer to new getentropy(3) page
    Michael Kerrisk
        Starting with glibc 2.25, getrandom() is now declared in <sys/random.h>
    Michael Kerrisk
        glibc support was added in version 2.25

getrlimit.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document role of RLIMIT_NOFILE for FD passing over UNIX sockets

getxattr.2
listxattr.2
    Andreas Gruenbacher
        Document E2BIG errors

inotify_add_watch.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note "inode" as a synonym for "filesystem object"
            Consistent with clarifications just made in inotify(7).

ioctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add ioctl_ns(2), ioctl_iflags(2)

ioctl_fat.2
    Brian Masney
        Correctly reference volume ID instead of volume label

kcmp.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention the clone(2) flags relating to various kcmp() 'type' values
    Michael Kerrisk
        KCMP_FILE: note reasons why FDs may refer to same open file description

link.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        When using linkat() AT_EMPTY_PATH, 'olddirfd' must not be a directory
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: add EPERM for immutable/append-only files
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note limits where EMLINK is encountered on ext4 and Btrfs

listxattr.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Eliminate extra E2BIG error text
            Andreas' patch added a second description of E2BIG that
            was (mostly) more detailed than the existing text. Combine
            the two texts.

lseek.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        O_APPEND overrides the effect of lseek() when doing file writes
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove ancient info about whence values and return values on old systems
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove slightly bogus advice about race conditions
            The page already (by now) contains a reference to open(2)
            for a discussion of open file descriptions. Leave it at that,
            since the reader can then deduce how things work.

madvise.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that madvise() is generally about improving performance

mbind.2
    Krzysztof Kulakowski  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Update MPOL_BIND description
            The behavior of MPOL_BIND changed in Linux 2.6.26.

        Refer to mount_namespaces(7) for details of default propagation type

nanosleep.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe "creeping sleep" problem
            nanosleep() has a problem if used in a program that catches
            signals and those signals are delivered at a very high rate.
            Describe the problem, and note that clock_nanosleep(2)
            provides a solution.
    Michael Kerrisk
        BUGS: explicitly note that the Linux 2.4 bug was fixed in Linux 2.6

    Michael Kerrisk
        Make it clear that O_APPEND implies atomicity
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify distinction between file creation flags and file status flags
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note ambiguity of ELOOP error when using O_NOFOLLOW

    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that O_NOFOLLOW is now in POSIX

poll.2
select.2
    Nicolas Biscos
        Add a reference to the sigset discussion in sigprocmask(2)
            A little while back, I added a note to sigprocmask.2 that
            discussed the difference between the libc's and the kernel's
            sigset_t structures.  I added that note, because I saw this being
            done wrong in a tool tracing system calls (causing subtle bugs).
            As it turns out, the same bugs existed for ppoll and pselect, for
            the same reason. I'm hoping by adding the reference here, future
            writers of similar tools will find that discussion and not make
            the same mistake.

posix_fadvise.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
            It may be helpful for the reader of this page to know about
            /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reorganize some text
            Details for various flags were hidden under NOTES.
            Move them to DESCRIPTION, to make the details more
            obvious.
    Michael Kerrisk
        One can use open(2) + mmap(2) + mincore(2) as a 'fincore'
            Note that open(2) + mmap(2) + mincore(2) can be used to get a view
            of which pages of a file are currently cached.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Maik Zumstrull]
        Note that POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED *may* try to write back dirty pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: mincore(2)

prctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that the ambient capability set is per-thread
    Keno Fischer
        Be more precise in what causes dumpable to reset
    Michael Kerrisk
        The no_new_privs setting is per-thread (not per-process)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention /proc/PID/status 'NoNewPrivs' field
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add reference to seccomp(2) in discussion of PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS

ptrace.2
    Omar Sandoval
        Clarify description of PTRACE_O_EXITKILL

read.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Kai NODA]
        Rework text in DESCRIPTION that talks about limits for 'count'
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86061
    Michael Kerrisk  [Steven Luo]
        Remove crufty text about EINTR and partial read
            Remove bogus text saying that POSIX permits partial read
            to return -1/EINTR on interrupt by a signal handler.
            That statement already ceased to be true in SUSv1 (1995)!

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=193111

readv.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove generic advice about mixing stdio and syscalls on same file
            There is nothing specific to readv()/writev() about this advice.

recv.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Vincent Bernat]
        Remove duplicate paragraph
            man-pages-1.34 included changes that duplicated an existing
            paragraph. Remove that duplicate.
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add ip(7), ipv6(7), tcp(7), udp(7), unix(7)

remap_file_pages.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        remap_file_pages() has been replaced by a slower in-kernel emulation

send.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add ipv6(7), socket(7), unix(7)

setxattr.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: add EPERM for immutable/append-only files

signalfd.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        signalfd() doesn't play well with helper programs spawned by libraries
            See https://lwn.net/Articles/415684/.
    Michael Kerrisk
        signalfd can't be used to receive synchronously generated signals
            Signals such as the SIGSEGV that results from an invalid
            memory access can be caught only with a handler.

stat.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        EXAMPLE: extend program to also show ID of the containing device
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: mention fstatat() AT_NO_AUTOMOUNT in discussion of automounting

statfs.2
    Namhyung Kim
        Add more filesystem types
            Add missing magic numbers from /usr/include/linux/magic.h

syscall.2
    Mike Frysinger
        Add endian details with 64-bit splitting
            Architectures that split 64-bit values across register pairs
            usually do so according to their C ABI calling convention (which
            means endianness).  Add some notes to that effect, and change the
            readahead example to show a little endian example (since that is
            way more common than big endian).

            Also start a new list of syscalls that this issue does not apply
            to.
    Mike Frysinger
        Note parisc handling of aligned register pairs
            While parisc would normally have the same behavior as ARM/PowerPC,
            they decide to write shim syscall stubs to unpack/realign rather
            than expose the padding to userspace.

tkill.2
    Jann Horn
        Document EAGAIN error for real-time signals

truncate.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note use of ftruncate() for POSIX shared memory objects

unlink.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: add EPERM error for immutable/read-only files

vfork.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain why the child should not call exit(3)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Another reason to use vfork() is to avoid overcommitting memory
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note some caveats re the use of vfork()
            Inspired by Rich Felker's post at http://ewontfix.com/7/.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=191261
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note the open(2) flags that correspond to the 'mode' argument

getopt.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reword discussion of error handling and reporting
            The existing description was hard to understand. Break
            it into a bullet list that separates out the details
            in a manner that is easier to parse.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Correct details of use of <stdio.h> to get getopt() declaration

        Fix a small bug in example code
            Move the second call to va_end(ap) to above the if-block that
            precedes it, so that the va_list 'ap' will be cleaned up in
            all cases.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Nadav Har'El]
        As a nonstandard extension, GNU treats 'll' and 'L' as synonyms
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=190341.

sem_wait.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Fabjan Sukalia]
        Remove statement that SA_RESTART does not cause restarting
            This has not been true since Linux 2.6.22. The description
            of EINTR maintains a reference to signal(7), which explains
            the historical details.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=192071

sleep.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mike Frysiner]

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

ioctl_userfaultfd.2
    Michael Kerrisk, Mike Rapoport
        New page describing ioctl(2) operations for userfaultfd

statx.2
    David Howells, Michael Kerrisk  [Andreas Dilger]
        New page describing statx(2) system call added in Linux 4.11

userfaultfd.2
    Mike Rapoport, Michael Kerrisk  [Andrea Arcangeli]
        New page describing userfaultfd(2) system call.

pthread_atfork.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        New page describing pthread_atfork(3)

slabinfo.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite to try to bring the content close to current reality
            There's still gaps to fill in, but the existing page
            was in any case hugely out of date.

inode.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        New page with information about inodes
            David Howells provided a statx(2) page that duplicated much of
            the information from stat(2). Avoid such duplication
            by moving the common information in stat(2) and statx(2)
            to a new page.


Renamed pages
--------------

ioctl_console.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Renamed from console_ioctl.4
            Most ioctl() man pages are in section 2, so move this one there
            for consistency.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note type of 'argp' for a various operations
            For some commands, there was no clear statement about the type
            of the 'argp' argument.

ioctl_tty.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Renamed from tty_ioctl(4)
            All other ioctl(2) pages are in section 2. Make this
            page consistent.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Packet mode state change events give POLLPRI events for poll(2)


Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

ioctl_ns.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document the NS_GET_NSTYPE operation added in Linux 4.11
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document the NS_GET_OWNER_UID operation added in Linux 4.11

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document /proc/sys/kernel/sched_child_runs_first

namespaces.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document the /proc/sys/user/* files added in Linux 4.9

socket.7
    Francois Saint-Jacques, Michael Kerrisk
        Document SO_INCOMING_CPU


New and changed links
---------------------

console_ioctl.4
    Michael Kerrisk
        Link for old name of ioctl_console(2) page

tty_ioctl.4
    Michael Kerrisk
        Link for old name of ioctl_tty(2) page


Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change page cross-references from tty_ioctl(4) to ioctl_tty(2)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change page cross-references for console_ioctl(4) to ioctl_console(2)


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

alarm.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add timer_create(2) and timerfd_create(2)

chmod.2
fsync.2
mkdir.2
mknod.2
open.2
truncate.2
umask.2
utime.2
utimensat.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add/replace references to inode(7)

clone.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        CLONE_NEWCGROUP by an unprivileged process also causes an EPERM error

clone.2
unshare.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Exceeding one of the limits in /proc/sys/user/* can cause ENOSPC
    Michael Kerrisk
        CLONE_NEWPID yields ENOSPC if nesting limit of PID namespaces is reached
    Michael Kerrisk
        Exceeding the maximum nested user namespace limit now gives ENOSPC
            Formerly, if the limit of 32 nested user namespaces was exceeded,
            the error EUSERS resulted. Starting with Linux 4.9, the error
            is ENOSPC.

epoll_ctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Defer to poll(2) for an explanation of EPOLLIN
    Michael Kerrisk  [Nicolas Biscos]
        EPOLLERR is also set on write end of a pipe when the read end is closed
    Michael Kerrisk  [Nicolas Biscos]
        Give the reader a clue that the 'events' field can be zero
            'events' specified as zero still allows EPOLLHUP and
            EPOLLERR to be reported.

_exit.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        On exit, child processes may be inherited by a "subreaper"
            It is no longer necessarily true that orphaned processes
            are inherited by PID 1.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Only the least significant byte of exit status is passed to the parent

fcntl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention memfd_create() in the discussion of file seals
            Give the reader a clue about what kinds of objects can
            be employed with file seals.
    Michael Kerrisk
        File seals are not generally applicable to tmpfs(5) files
            As far as I can see, file seals can be applied only to
            memfd_create(2) file descriptors. This was checked by experiment
            and by reading mm/shmem.c::shmem_get_inode((), where one finds
            the following line that applies to all new shmem files:

                            info->seals = F_SEAL_SEAL;

            Only in the code of the memfd_create() system call is this
            setting reversed (in mm/shmem.c::memfd_create):

                    if (flags & MFD_ALLOW_SEALING)
                            info->seals &= ~F_SEAL_SEAL;

fork.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add pthread_atfork(3)

getdents.2
open.2
stat.2
statx.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add inode(7)

getdtablesize.2
attr.5
    Alexander Miller
        Move .so directive to first line
            Improves compatibility with the man and other dumb tools
            that process man page files.

getpid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention init(1) and "subreapers" in discussion of parent PID

ioctl_list.2
    Cyril Hrubis  [Arnd Bergmann]
        BLKRASET/BLKRAGET take unsigned long

ioctl_ns.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: document ENOTTY

kexec_load.2
sched_setaffinity.2
bootparam.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt is now in Documentation/admin-guide/

lseek.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add fallocate(2)
            Both of these pages discuss file holes.

mincore.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add fincore(1)

mmap.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove ancient reference to flags that appear on some other systems
            MAP_AUTOGROW, MAP_AUTORESRV, MAP_COPY, and MAP_LOCAL may have
            appeared on some systems many years ago, but  the discussion here
            mentions no details and the systems and flags probably ceased to
            be relevant long ago. So, remove this text.
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add userfaultfd(2)

open.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add statx() to list of "at" calls in rationale discussion

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Expand discussion of POLLPRI
    Michael Kerrisk  [Nicolas Biscos]
        POLLERR is also set on write end of a pipe when the read end is closed

posix_fadvise.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add fincore(1)

prctl.2
    Mike Frysinger
        PR_SET_MM: Refine CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE requirement
            The Linux 3.10 release dropped the c/r requirement and opened it
            up to all users.
    Mike Frysinger
        PR_SET_MM: Document new PR_SET_MM_MAP{,_SIZE} helpers
    Mike Frysinger
        PR_SET_MM: Document arg4/arg5 zero behavior
            The kernel will immediately reject calls where arg4/arg5 are not
            zero.  See kernel/sys.c:prctl_set_mm().
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain rationale for use of subreaper processes
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note semantics of child_subreaper setting on fork() and exec()
    Michael Kerrisk
        Improve description of PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER

rename.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Georg Sauthoff]
        Note that there is no glibc wrapper for renameat2()

sched_setaffinity.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add get_nprocs(3)

    Michael Kerrisk
        Give a hint that sets must be reinitialized if using select() in a loop
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer to POLLPRI in poll(2) for info on exceptional conditions
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move mislocated text describing the self-pipe text from BUGS to NOTES

sigaction.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Show the prototype of an SA_SIGINFO signal handler

signalfd.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SIGKILL and SIGSTOP are silently ignored in 'mask'

sigprocmask.2
    Dmitry V. Levin
        Do not specify an exact value of rt_sigprocmask's 4th argument
            As sizeof(kernel_sigset_t) is not the same for all architectures,
            it would be better not to mention any numbers as its value.
    Michael Kerrisk
        'set' and 'oldset' can both be NULL

sigwaitinfo.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        sigwaitinfo() can't be used to accept synchronous signals

socketcall.2
    Mike Frysinger
       Document call argument

stat.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove information migrated to inode(7) page
    Michael Kerrisk
        Restructure field descriptions as a hanging list
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove "Other systems" subsection
            These details about other systems were added in 1999,
            and were probably of limited use then, and even less today.
            However, they do clutter the page, so remove them.
    Michael Kerrisk
        DESCRIPTION: add list entries for 'st_uid' and 'st_gid'
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some subsection headings to ease readability
    David Howells
        ERRORS: correct description of ENOENT
    Michael Kerrisk
        Give 'struct stat' argument a more meaningful name ('statbuf')
    Marcin Ślusarz
        Tweak description of AT_EMPTY_PATH
            Currently it says when dirfd is AT_FDCWD it can be something
            other than directory, which doesn't make much sense. Just swap
            the order of sentences.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add slightly expanded description of 'st_ino' field
    Michael Kerrisk
        DESCRIPTION: add a list entry for 'st_ino'
    Michael Kerrisk
        DESCRIPTION: add a list entry for 'st_nlinks' field

        Add membarrier(2)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix kernel version for userfaultfd(2)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Linux 4.11 added statx()

    Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos  [Michael Kerrisk, Florian Weimer]
        Correct header file
    Michael Kerrisk  [Frank Theile]

        Tell a more nuanced story about what grantpt() does or does not do

insque.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add queue(3)

queue.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add insque(3)

shm_open.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that POSIX shared memory uses tmpfs(5)

        Reorganize page text for easier parsing and better readability
    Michael Kerrisk
        Various rewordings and improvements
    Michael Kerrisk

    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add journalctl(1)

ttyname.3

    Christian Brauner
        NOTES: warn about a confusing case that may occur with mount namespaces

wcsdup.3
    Jan Heberer
        RETURN VALUE: fix error in return value description
            Return value for failure was accidentally changed from NULL to
            -1 in man-pages commit 572acb41c48b6b8e690d50edff367d8b8b01702a.

elf.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add elfedit(1), nm(1), size(1), strings(1), and strip(1)

nsswitch.conf.5
    Florian Weimer
        Mention sudoers
            It turns out that sudo drops things into nsswitch.conf, too.

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer to namespaces(7) for discussion of /proc/sys/user/* files
    Michael Kerrisk
        Simplify /proc/slabinfo entry
            Don't repeat (out-of-date) info from slabinfo(5); just defer to
            that page.

tmpfs.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        tmpfs supports extended attributes, but not 'user' extended attributes

environ.7
    Jakub Wilk
        Fix name of function that honors TMPDIR
            tempnam() takes the TMPDIR environment variable into account, unlike
            tmpnam(), which always creates pathnames within /tmp.

hostname.7
    Marko Myllynen
        Use lower case for hostname example
    Marko Myllynen
        Use generic names in examples
    Marko Myllynen
        Describe accepted characters for hostname

inotify.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Nicolas Iooss]
        Mounting a filesystem on top of a monitored directory causes no event

man-pages.7

        Note preferred approach for 'duplicate' errors

pid_namespaces.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        The maximum nesting depth for PID namespaces is 32

user_namespaces.7
    Stephan Bergmann
        Fixes to example
            While toying around with the userns_child_exec example program on the
            user_namespaces(7) man page, I noticed two things:

            * In the EXAMPLE section, we need to mount the new /proc before
              looking at /proc/$$/status, otherwise the latter will print
              information about the outer namespace's PID 1 (i.e., the real
              init).  So the two paragraphs need to be swapped.

            * In the program source, make sure to close pipe_fd[0] in the
              child before exec'ing.

pthreads.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add pthread_rwlockattr_setkind_np(3)

pty.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention a couple of other applications of pseudoterminals

sem_overview.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add shm_overview(7)

signal.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add sigreturn(2)

tcp.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note indications for OOB data given by select(2) and poll(2)
    Chema Gonzalez
        tcp_abc was removed in 3.9

xattr.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add ioctl_iflags(2)
            People sometimes confuse xattrs and inode flags. Provide a link
            to the page that describes inode flags to give them a tip.

ld.so.8
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention quoting when using "Rpath tokens" in LD_AUDIT and LD_PRELOAD
    Michael Kerrisk
        Expand description of /etc/ld.so.preload
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention ldconfig(8) in discussion of /etc/ld.so.cache

zdump.8
    Jakub Wilk
        Add OPTIONS section heading

Apologies if I missed anyone!


New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

ioctl_getfsmap.2
    Darrick J. Wong
        Document the GETFSMAP ioctl
            Document the new GETFSMAP ioctl that returns the physical layout of a
            (disk-based) filesystem.


Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

namespaces.7
    Kirill Tkhai  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Document the /proc/[pid]/ns/pid_for_children file


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

ldd.1
    Michael Kerrisk
        'objdump -p prog | grep NEEDED' doesn't give quite same info as 'ldd'

chmod.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Put fchmod() feature test macro requirements in a more readable format
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note glibc 2.24 feature test macro requirements changes for fchmod()

chown.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        When file owner or group is changed, file capabilities are cleared
    Michael Kerrisk
        Changes to file owner by root also clear set-UID and set-GID bits

clone.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update BUGS to reflect fact that PID caching was removed in glibc 2.25

epoll_wait.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify semantics of returned 'data' field
            The returned 'data' is the 'data' most recently set via
            epoll_ctl().

get_mempolicy.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Nadav Har'El, Andi Kleen]
        SYNOPSIS: fix return type of get_mempolicy()
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97051

getpid.2
    Carlos O'Donell, Michael Kerrisk
        Note that PID caching is removed as of glibc 2.25
            Since glibc 2.25 the PID cache is removed.

            Rationale given in the release notes:
            https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Release/2.25#pid_cache_removal

ioctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add ioctl_getfsmap(2)

ioctl_getfsmap.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix ordering of sections
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add VERSIONS section
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: order alphabetically

madvise.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove bogus text re POSIX_MADV_NOREUSE
            There is a POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE for posix_fadvise(),
            but no POSIX_MADV_NOREUSE for any API in POSIX.

membarrier.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add ENOSYS error for 'nohz_full' CPU setting

mount.2
    NeilBrown
        Revise description of MS_REMOUNT | MS_BIND
            MS_REMOUNT|MS_BIND affects all per-mount-point
            flag.  MS_RDONLY is only special because it,
            uniquely, is both a per-mount-point flag *and* a
            per-filesystem flag.

            So the sections of per-mount-point flags and
            MS_REMOUNT can usefully be clarified.

open.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note some further advantages of the *at() APIs

pipe.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add tee(2) and vmsplice(2)

readv.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        glibc 2.26 adds library support for preadv2() and pwritev2()

sched_setaffinity.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention cpuset cgroups as a cause of EINVAL error

seccomp.2
    Mike Frysinger
        Expand SECCOMP_RET_KILL documentation

sigaction.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note feature test macro requirements for 'si_code' constants
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add a subheading for the description of 'si_code'
    Michael Kerrisk
        TRAP_BRANCH and TRAP_HWBKPT are present only on IA64

sigaltstack.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that specifying SS_ONSTACK in ss.ss_flags decreases portability
            In the Illumos source (which presumably mirrors its Solaris
            ancestry), there is this check in the sigaltstack()
            implementation:

                           if (ss.ss_flags & ~SS_DISABLE)
                                    return (set_errno(EINVAL));

            And in the FreeBSD source we find similar:

                            if ((ss->ss_flags & ~SS_DISABLE) != 0)
                                    return (EINVAL);
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note buggy addition of ss.ss_flags==SS_ONSTACK
            Note buggy addition of ss.ss_flags==SS_ONSTACK as a synonym
            for ss_flags==0. No other implementation does this, AFAIK.
            And it was not needed :-(.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Specifying 'ss' returns the current settings without changing them
    Michael Kerrisk
        Give 'oss' argument a more meaningful name: 'old_ss'

dl_iterate_phdr.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        dl_iterate_phdr() shows the order in which objects were loaded
            dl_iterate_phdr() tells us not just which objects are
            loaded, but also the order in which they are loaded
            (the "link-map order"). Since the order is relevant for
            understanding symbol resolution, give the reader this clue.

            POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE is documented for posix_fadvise, and a
            corresponding POSIX_MADV_NOREUSE flag is not specified by POSIX.
            See https://bugs.debian.org/865699

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=195711
    Michael Kerrisk
        read() from an inotify FD is no longer interrupted by a stop signal
            (Change was in Linux 3.8.)

tcp.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document value '2' for tcp_timestamps
            Since Linux 4.10, the value '2' is meaningful for tcp_timestamps
    Ruben Kerkhof
        Change default value of tcp_frto
            The default changed in c96fd3d461fa495400df24be3b3b66f0e0b152f9

        Greatly expand the explanation of LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK
    Carlos O'Donell
        Expand DT_RUNPATH details.
            ld.so.8: Expand DT_RUNPATH details.

            Every 3 years we get asked why DT_RUNPATH doesn't work like DT_RPATH.
            The most recent question was here:
            https://www.sourceware.org/ml/libc-help/2017-06/msg00013.html

            We need to expand the description of DT_RUNPATH to cover this
            situation and explain that the DT_RUNPATH entries apply only to the
            immediate DT_NEEDED, not that of another, say dlopen'd child object.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since glibc 2.2.5, LD_PROFILE is ignored in secure-execution mode
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make notes on secure-execute mode more prominent
            Place each note on secure-execution mode in a separate
            paragraph, to make it more obvious.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that libraries in standard directories are not normally set-UID
            In secure mode, LD_PRELOAD loads only libraries from standard
            directories that are marked set-UID. Note that it is unusual for
            a library to be marked in this way.
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add elf(5)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note version where secure-execution started ignoring LD_USE_LOAD_BIAS
    Michael Kerrisk
        Correct glibc version that ignores LD_SHOW_AUXV in secure-execution mode
            Ignored since 2.3.4 (not 2.3.5).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite LD_DEBUG_OUTPUT description and note that .PID is appended

Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Use .EX/.EE for EXAMPLE programs

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Use consistent markup for code snippets
            Change .nf/.fi to .EX/.EE

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Use consistent markup for code snippets
            The preferred form is

                .PP/.IP
                .in +4n
                .EX
                <code>
                .EE
                .in
                .PP/.IP

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Formatting fix: replace blank lines with .PP/.IP
            Blank lines shouldn't generally appear in *roff source (other
            than in code examples), since they create large vertical
            spaces between text blocks.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk  [Bjarni Ingi Gislason]
        Add a non-breaking space between a number and a unit (prefix)
            Based on a patch by Bjarni Ingi Gislason.

            kernel version to 4.12.

execve.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add get_robust_list(2)

getrandom.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Fabio Scotoni]

            This accords with glibc headers and the Linux kernel source.

getrlimit.2
    Thiago Jung Bauermann
        Mention unit used by RLIMIT_CORE and RLIMIT_FSIZE
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that RLIMIT_AS and RLIMIT_DATA are rounded down to system page size

        Mention unit for RLIMIT_DATA

getrlimit.2
mmap.2
malloc.3
    Jonas Grabber
        RLIMIT_DATA affects mmap(2) since Linux 4.7

        Update uffdio_api.features description
            There is no requirement that uffdio_api.features must be zero
            for newer kernels. This field actually defines what features
            space would like to enable.

io_submit.2
    Sage Weil
        Acknowledge possibility of short return
            Note that the return value may be a value less than 'nr'
            if not all iocbs were queued at once.

ipc.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add svipc(7)

keyctl.2
    Eugene Syromyatnikov

open.2
    NeilBrown
        Improve O_PATH documentation
            - fstatfs is now permitted.
            - ioctl isn't, and is worth listing explicitly
            - O_PATH allows an automount point to be opened with
              triggering the mount.

prctl.2
seccomp.2
    Eugene Syromyatnikov
        Update pointer to in-kernel seccomp documentation

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=196345

set_tid_address.2
    Elliott Hughes

socket.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Yubin Ruan]
        socket() uses the lowest available file descriptor

_syscall.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove redundant comment from EXAMPLE
            A discussion of the nroff source of the manual
            page isn't very useful...

sysfs.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add a pointer to sysfs(5) to help possibly confused readers
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make it clearer near the start of the page that sysfs(2) is obsolete

timer_create.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Strengthen the warning about use of printf() in the example program
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update cross reference: signal(7) should be signal-safety(7)

umount.2
    NeilBrown
        Revise MNT_FORCE description
            MNT_FORCE does not allow a busy filesystem to be unmounted.  Only
            MNT_DETACH allows that.  MNT_FORCE only tries to abort pending
            transactions, in the hope that might help umount not to block,

            Also, other filesystems than NFS support MNT_FORCE.

unshare.2
    Eugene Syromyatnikov
        Update pointer to in-kernel unshare documentation

wait.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Ильдар Низамов]
        POSIX.1-2008 TC1 clarifies treatment of 'si_pid' for waitid() WNOHANG

        Add a scatter/gather buffer to sample code
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reorganize the text somewhat (no content changes)

crypt.3
    Konstantin Shemyak  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Add description of previously undocumented 'rounds' parameter
    Konstantin Shemyak
        Encryption isn't done with SHA-xxx, but with a function based on SHA-xxx
    Konstantin Shemyak
        Clarify that ending of the salt string with '$' is optional

exit.3

    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add get_robust_list(2)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add a heading to delimit discussion of signals sent to other processes

exp2.3
    Alex Henrie
        Remove C89 designation

log1p.3
    Alex Henrie
        Document fixes to give EDOM or ERANGE on error

matherr.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that glibc 2.27 removes the 'matherr' mechanism
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty feature test macro requirements

pow10.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that pow10() is now obsolete in favor of exp10()
            Also, the pow10() functions are no longer supported by glibc,
            starting with version 2.27.

sincos.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that sincos() is intended to be more efficient than sin() + cos()

cciss.4
hpsa.4
    Eugene Syromyatnikov  [Don Brace, Meelis Roos]
        Mention cciss removal in Linux 4.14
            During the Linux 4.13 development cycle, the cciss driver has been
            removed in favor of the hpsa driver, which has been amended with
            some legacy board support.

initrd.4

host.conf.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add cross-reference to hosts(5)

locale.5
    Marko Myllynen
        Refer to existing locales for encoding details
            Since I don't think it would make sense to try to have different
            explanation for each glibc version on the locale(5) man page, I'm
            proposing that we apply the below patch so that we refer to
            existing locale definition files in general and not spell out the
            exact format or any certain locale as a definitive guideline.

nologin.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add a sentence explaining why nologin is useful

proc.5
    Eugene Syromyatnikov
        Document removal of htab-reclaim sysctl file

            according to historic Linux repository commit log.
    Eugene Syromyatnikov
        Add description for cpuN lines in /proc/stat

    Eugene Syromyatnikov
        Update reference to kernel's crypto API documentation

tzfile.5
    Paul Eggert
        Sync from tzdb upstream
            This makes tzfile.5 a copy of the tzdb version, except that the
            tzdb version's first line is replaced by man-pages boilerplate.
            The new version documents version 3 format, among other things.
            Also, it removes the "Summary of the timezone information file
            format" section, which should no longer be needed due to
            improvements in the part of the man page.

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note semantics for a program that is set-UID-root and has capabilities
            Note semantics for a program that is both set-user-ID-root and has
            file capabilities.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Dennis Knorr]
        Note that a set-UID-root program may have an empty file capability set

cgroups.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: systemd-cgls(1)

cpuset.7
    Eugene Syromyatnikov
        Update pointer to in-kernel cpusets documentation

keyrings.7
    Eugene Syromyatnikov
        Document description restriction for logon keys
            "logon" type has additional check that enforces colon-separated
            prefix in key descriptions.
    Eugene Syromyatnikov
        Add pointers to kernel's documentation
            Mostly because of asymmetric-keys.txt, which is outside
            security/keys for some reason.

man-pages.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Expand the guidance on formatting code snippets

netlink.7
    David Wilder
        Change buffer size in example code about reading netlink message

Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Consistently use "x86-64", not "x86_64"
            When referring to the architecture, consistently use "x86-64",
            not "x86_64". Hitherto, there was a mixture of usages, with
            "x86-64" predominant.

Various pages
    G. Branden Robinson
        Replace incorrect uses of Latin abbreviation "cf.".
            People seem to be using "cf." ("conferre"), which means "compare",
            to mean "see" instead, for which the Latin abbreviation would be
            "q.v." ("quod vide" -> "which see").

            In some cases "cf." might actually be the correct term but it's
            still not clear what specific aspects of a function/system call
            one is supposed to be comparing.

        Remove a redundant paragraph

connect.2
    Michael Kerrisk

    Michael Kerrisk  [Fabio Scotoni]
        ERRORS: add ENOSYS

getrlimit.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Scott Vokes]
        Make it clear RLIMIT_NPROC is a limit on current number of processes
            https://twitter.com/silentbicycle/status/893849097903505409

gettid.2

            io_submit() call.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add cross-reference to io_getevents(2)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Cross reference pwritev(2) in discussion of RWF_SYNC and RWF_DSYNC

membarrier.2
    Mathieu Desnoyers
        Update example to take TSO into account
            The existing example given specifically states that it focus on
            x86 (TSO memory model), but gives a read-read vs write-write
            ordering example, even though this scenario does not require
            explicit barriers on TSO.

            So either we change the example architecture to a weakly-ordered
            architecture, or we change the example to a scenario requiring
            barriers on x86.

            Let's stay on x86, but provide a Dekker as example instead.
    Mathieu Desnoyers
            Adapt the MEMBARRIER_CMD_SHARED return value documentation to
            reflect that it now returns -EINVAL when issued on a system
            configured for nohz_full.

memfd_create.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note the limit for size of 'name'

mkdir.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Raghavendra D Prabhu]
        ERRORS: document EINVAL error for invalid filename

mmap.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add explicit text noting that 'length' must be greater than 0
            Currently, this detail is hidden in ERRORS. Make it clear in
            the main text.
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add ftruncate(2)

mremap.2
    Mike Kravetz  [Florian Weimer, Jann Horn]
        Add description of old_size == 0 functionality
            Since at least the 2.6 time frame, mremap() would create a new
            mapping of the same pages if 'old_size == 0'.  It would also leave
            the original mapping.  This was used to create a 'duplicate
            mapping'.

            A recent change was made to mremap() so that an attempt to create a
            duplicate a private mapping will fail.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Michal Hocko, Mike Kravetz]
        BUGS: describe older behavior for old_size==0 on private mappings
            Explain the older behavior, and why it changed. This is a
            follow-up to Mike Kravetz's patch documenting the behavior
            for old_size==0 with shared mappings.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reformat EINVAL errors as a list

open.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        By contrast with O_RDONLY, no file permissions are required for O_PATH
            Note one of the significant advantages of O_PATH: many of the
            operations applied to O_PATH file descriptors don't require
            read permission, so there's no reason why the open() itself
            should require read permission.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note use of O_PATH to provide O_EXEC functionality
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention O_PATH file descriptor use with fexecve(3)
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: document EINVAL error for invalid filename
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that O_TMPFILE creates a *regular* file
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make it explicit that O_CREAT creates a regular file
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since glibc 2.26, the open() wrapper always uses the openat() syscall
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change pathname used in discussion of rationale for openat()
            /path/to/file is a little confusing as a pathname
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make the purpose of open() a little clearer at the start of the page

open_by_handle_at.2
    NeilBrown
        Clarifications needed due to NFS reexport
    NeilBrown  [Lennart Poettering]
        Clarify MAX_HANDLE_SZ
            As hinted in the kernel source, MAX_HANDLE_SZ is a hint
            rather than a promise.

pipe.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Marin H.]
        Since Linux 4.5, fcntl() can be used to set O_DIRECT for a pipe
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=197917

pivot_root.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add switch_root(8)

pkey_alloc.2
    Breno Leitao
        Fix argument order
            Currently pkey_alloc() syscall has two arguments, and the very
            first argument is still not supported and should be set to zero.
            The second argument is the one that should specify the
            page access rights.

ptrace.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add ltrace(1)

reboot.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Michał Zegan]
        Fix bogus description of reboot() from non-initial PID namespace
            The current text was confused (mea culpa). No signal is sent to
            the init() process. Rather, depending on the 'cmd' given to
            reboot(), the 'group_exit_code' value will set to either SIGHUP or
            SIGINT, with the effect that one of those signals is reported to
            wait() in the parent process.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=195899
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: remove reboot(8) (synonym for halt(8)); add shutdown(8)
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add systemctl(1), systemd(1)

recvmmsg.2
sendmmsg.2
    Elliot Hughes
        Type fixes in SYNOPSIS
            [mtk: The raw system calls use "unsigned int", but the glibc
            wrappers have "int" for the 'flags' argument.]

sched_setaffinity.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add numactl(8)

sched_yield.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Peter Zijlstra]
        sched_yield() is intended for use with real-time scheduling policies

seccomp.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Adhemerval Zanella, Florian Weimer, Kees Cook]
        Add some Caveats regarding the use of seccomp filters
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document the "default" filter return action
            The kernel defaults to either SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS
            or SECCOMP_RET_KILL_THREAD for unrecognized filter
            return action values.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Kees Cook]
        Change SECCOMP_RET_ACTION to SECCOMP_RET_ACTION_FULL
            In Linux 4.14, the action component of the return value
            switched from being 15 bits to being 16 bits. A new macro,
            SECCOMP_RET_ACTION_FULL, that masks the 16 bits was added,
            to replace the older SECCOMP_RET_ACTION.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explicitly note that other threads survive SECCOMP_RET_KILL_THREAD
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add strace(1)

send.2
    Grégory Vander Schueren
        Add EALREADY to ERRORS

setns.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add nsenter(1)

shmop.2
    Yubin Ruan
        Note that return value of shmat() is page-aligned

sigaction.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework discussion of SA_SIGINFO handler arguments
            Expand and rework the text a little, in particular adding
            a reference to sigreturn(2) as a source of further
            information about the ucontext argument.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention that libc sets the act.sa_restorer field

sigaltstack.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Walter Harms]
        Reword BUGS text to be a little clearer
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add explicit error handling to example code
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add use of sigaction() to example code

sigreturn.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make it a little clearer that a stack frame is created by the kernel
    Michael Kerrisk
        glibc has a simple wrapper for sigreturn() that returns ENOSYS

splice.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since Linux 2.6.31,'fd_in' and 'fd_out' may both refer to pipes

stat.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Richard Knutsson]
        Use lstat() instead of stat()
            It's more logical to use lstat() in the example code,
            since one can then experiment with symbolic links, and
            also the S_IFLNK case can also occur.
    NeilBrown
        Correct AT_NO_AUTOMOUNT text and general revisions
            Expand on the relationship between fstatat() and the other three
            functions, and improve the description of AT_NO_AUTOMOUNT.
            Specifically, both  stat() and lstat() act the same way with
            respect to automounts, and that behavior matches fstatat() with
            the AT_NO_AUTOMOUNT flag.

statfs.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some comments noting filesystems that are no longer current
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add comments describing a few filesystem types

time.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that time() may be implemented in the vDSO
    Michael Kerrisk  [Victor Porton]
        Language fix-up: clarify that "tasks" means "work"
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=197183

userfaultfd.2
    Mike Rapoport
        BUGS: document spurious UFFD_EVENT_FORK

write.2
fsync.2
close.2
    NeilBrown  [Jeff Layton]
        Update description of error codes
            Since 4.13, errors from writeback are more reliably reported
            to all file descriptors that might be relevant.

            Add notes to this effect, and also add detail about ENOSPC and
            EDQUOT which can be delayed in a similar many to EIO - for NFS
            in particular.

abort.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Starting with glibc 2.27, abort() does not attempt to flush streams
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add assert(3)

backtrace_symbols_fd(3)
    Stefan Puiu  [Walter Harms]
        backtrace_symbols_fd() can trigger a call to malloc()

    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add daemon(7), logrotate(8)

errno.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note use of errno(1) to look up error names and numbers
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update error list for POSIX.1-2008
            POSIX.1-2008 specified a couple of new errors not present in
            POSIX.1-2001.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Walter Harms]
        Note the use of perror(3) and strerror(3)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Recast the advice against manually declaring 'errno'
            Recast the advice against manually declaring 'errno' to
            a more modern perspective. It's 13 years since the original
            text was added, and even then it was describing old behavior.
            Cast the description to be about behavior further away in
            time, and note more clearly that manual declaration will
            cause problems with modern C libraries.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some missing errors
    Michael Kerrisk
        Error numbers are positive values (rather than nonzero values)
            POSIX.1-2008 noted the explicitly the change (to align with
            the C standards) that error numbers are positive, rather
            than nonzero.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reorganize the text and add some subheadings
            Restructure the text and add some subheadings for better
            readability. No (intentional) content changes.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Wesley Aptekar-Cassels]
        Note that error numbers vary somewhat across architectures
            Added after a patch from Wesley Aptekar-Cassels that proposed
            to add error numbers to the text.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note the <errno.h> also provides the symbolic error names
    Michael Kerrisk  [Walter Harms]
        Explicitly note that error numbers vary also across UNIX systems

exec.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        glibc 2.24 dropped CWD from the default path
            Document the glibc 2.24 change that dropped CWD from the default
            search path employed by execlp(), execvp() and execvpe() when
            PATH is not defined.

fexecve.3
    Michael Kerrisk

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=194601

makedev.3
    Adrian Bunk
        glibc has deprecated exposing the definitions via <sys/types.h>

mallinfo.3
    Jakub Wilk
        Fix the example
            Remove reference to non-standard "tlpi_hdr.h" and replace calls to
            functions that were declared in this header.

malloc.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add valgrind(1)

popen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add a cross reference to Caveats in system(3)
            All of the same risks regarding system() also apply to popen().

pthread_detach.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rahul Bedarkar]
        Improve sentence describing freeing of resources on process termination
            As reported by Rahul, the existing sentence could be read as
            meaning that resources of joined and terminated detached
            threads are freed only at process termination. Eliminate
            that possible misreading.

pthread_yield.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Peter Zijlstra]
        pthread_yield() is intended for use with real-time scheduling policies

ld.so.8
    Michael Kerrisk  [Yubin Ruan]
        Simplify language around conferring capabilities
            The statement "conferring permitted or effective capabilities"
            to the process is somewhat redundant. Binaries with capabilities
            confer capabilities only to those process capability sets, so it's
            simpler to just say "confers capabilities to the process".

fcntl.2
read.2
write.2
    NeilBrown
        Document "Lost locks" as cause for EIO.
            If an advisory lock is lost, then read/write requests on any
            affected file descriptor can return EIO - for NFSv4 at least.

memfd_create.2
    Michael Kerrisk

mlock.2
    Michael Kerrisk

        glibc support for mlock2() is added in version 2.27

mmap.2
    John Hubbard  [Michael Hocko]
        MAP_FIXED is no longer discouraged
            MAP_FIXED has been widely used for a very long time, yet the man
            page still claims that "the use of this option is discouraged".
    John Hubbard
        MAP_FIXED updated documentation
                -- Expand the documentation to discuss the hazards in
                   enough detail to allow avoiding them.

                -- Mention the upcoming MAP_FIXED_SAFE flag.

                -- Enhance the alignment requirement slightly.

    Michael Kerrisk
        Places errors in alphabetical order (no content changes)

veth.4
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add network_namespaces(7)

sysfs.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer to cgroups(7) for information about files in /sys/kernel/cgroup

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note which capability sets are affected by SECBIT_NO_SETUID_FIXUP
            Note explicitly that SECBIT_NO_SETUID_FIXUP is relevant for
            the permitted, effective, and ambient capability sets.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Deemphasize the ancient prctl(2) PR_SET_KEEPCAPS command
            The modern approach is SECBITS_KEEP_CAPS.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify effect of CAP_SETFCAP
            Make it clear that CAP_SETFCAP allows setting arbitrary
            capabilities on a file.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify which capability sets are effected by SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS
            This flag has relevance only for the process permitted and
            effective sets.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rephrase CAP_SETPCAP description
            * Mention kernel versions.
            * Place current kernel behavior first
    Michael Kerrisk
        SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS is ignored if SECBIT_NO_SETUID_FIXUP is set
    Michael Kerrisk
        Ambient set is also cleared when UIDs are set to nonzero value

cgroups.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add a more complete description of cgroup v1 named hierarchies
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add a section on unmounting cgroup v1 filesystems
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add subsection describing cgroups v2 subtree delegation

    Nikolay Borisov
        Add information about RDMA controller
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite the description of cgroup v2 subtree control
    Michael Kerrisk  [Tejun Heo]
        Note Linux 4.11 changes to cgroup v2 delegation containment rules
    Michael Kerrisk
        systemd(1) nowadays automatically mounts the cgroup2 filesystem
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that cgroup.controllers is read-only
    Michael Kerrisk
        Elaborate a little on problems of splitting threads across cgroups in v1
    Michael Kerrisk  [Tejun Heo]
        Tweak the description of delegation of cgroup.subtree_control

ip.7
    Ricardo Biehl Pasquali
        INADDR_* values cannot be assigned directly to 's_addr'
    Michael Kerrisk
        s/INADDR_ANY/INADDR_LOOPBACK/ in discussion of htonl()
            INADDR_LOOPBACK is a better example, since it is not
            byte-order neutral.

namespaces.7
network_namespaces.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move content from namespaces(7) to network_namespaces(7)

pid_namespaces.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add mount_namespaces(7)

sched.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Andrea Parri]
        Correctly describe effect of priority changes for RT threads
            The placement of a thread in the run queue for its new
            priority depends on the direction of movement in priority.
            (This appears to contradict POSIX, except in the case of
            pthread_setschedprio().)

user_namespaces.7
    Michael Kerrisk

Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

membarrier.2
    Mathieu Desnoyers  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Document new membarrier commands introduced in Linux 4.16
            Document the following membarrier commands introduced in
            Linux 4.16:

                MEMBARRIER_CMD_GLOBAL_EXPEDITED
                    (the old enum label MEMBARRIER_CMD_SHARED is now an
                    alias to preserve header backward compatibility)
                MEMBARRIER_CMD_REGISTER_GLOBAL_EXPEDITED
                MEMBARRIER_CMD_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED_SYNC_CORE
                MEMBARRIER_CMD_REGISTER_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED_SYNC_CORE

mmap.2
    Jan Kara  [Ross Zwisler, Michael Kerrisk]
        Add description of MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE and MAP_SYNC
    Michal Hocko  [John Hubbard, Michael Kerrisk, Jann Horn]
        Document new MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE flag
            4.17+ kernels offer a new MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE flag which allows
            the caller to atomically probe for a given address range.

readv.2
io_submit.2
    Jürg Billeter
        Document RWF_APPEND added in Linux 4.16

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe file capability versioning
    Michael Kerrisk  [Serge E. Hallyn]
        Document namespaced-file capabilities
        [There's still more work to be done on this new text]


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

bpf.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update list of architectures that support JITed eBPF
            And note kernel version numbers where support is added.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Kernel 4.15 added CONFIG_BPF_JIT_ALWAYS_ON
            This causes the JIT compiler to be always on and
            forces bpf_jit_enable to 1.

execve.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that describing execve as "executing a new process" is misleading
            This misdescription is so common that it's worth calling it out
            explicitly.
    Michael Kerrisk
        More explicitly describe effect of execve() in the opening paragraph

fallocate.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since Linux 4.16, Btrfs supports FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE

getrlimit.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capability is required in *initial user namespace*

io_submit.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add kernel version numbers for various 'aio_rw_flags' flags
    Michael Kerrisk
        Place 'aio_rw_flags' in alphabetical order

mmap.2
    Jann Horn
        MAP_FIXED is okay if the address range has been reserved
            Clarify that MAP_FIXED is appropriate if the specified address
            range has been reserved using an existing mapping, but shouldn't
            be used otherwise.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move the text on MAP_FIXED to NOTES
            This text has become rather long, making it somewhat
            unwieldy in the discussion of the mmap() flags. Therefore,
            move it to NOTES, with a pointer in DESCRIPTION referring
            the reader to NOTES.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Heinrich Schuchardt]
        Clarify that when addr==NULL, address chosen by kernel is page-aligned
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add a little historical detail on the obsolete MAP_DENYWRITE

mount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: add EBUSY for the case of trying to stack same mount twice
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove a couple of obsolete EBUSY errors
            As far as I can tell, these EBUSY errors disappeared
            with the addition of stackable mounts in Linux 2.4.

msgget.2
semget.2
shmget.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        The purpose of "flags" == 0 is to obtain ID of an existing IPC object
            This was implied in these pages, but the meaning of "flags" == 0
            could be more explicit, as indicated by questions such as
            https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49833569/flag-value-of-semget-function

open.2
    Jann Horn
        Document more -ETXTBSY conditions
    Jakub Wilk
        Add missing argument for snprintf() in example code

perf_event_open.2
    Song Liu
        Add type kprobe and uprobe
            Two new types kprobe and uprobe are being added to
            perf_event_open(), which allow creating kprobe or
            uprobe with perf_event_open. This patch adds
            information about these types.

ptrace.2
    Jann Horn
        Copy retval info for SECCOMP_GET_FILTER to right section
            The "RETURN VALUE" section made a claim that was incorrect for
            PTRACE_SECCOMP_GET_FILTER. Explicitly describe the behavior of
            PTRACE_SECCOMP_GET_FILTER in the "RETURN VALUE" section (as
            usual), but leave the now duplicate description in the section
            describing PTRACE_SECCOMP_GET_FILTER, since the
            PTRACE_SECCOMP_GET_FILTER section would otherwise probably become
            harder to understand.

readv.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove redundant sentence

seccomp.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that execve() may change syscall numbers during life of process
            On a multiarch/multi-ABI platform such as modern x86, each
            architecture/ABI (x86-64, x32, i386)has its own syscall numbers,
            which means a seccomp() filter may see different syscall numbers
            over the life of the process if that process uses execve() to
            execute programs that has a different architectures/ABIs.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note which architectures support seccomp BPF
    Michael Kerrisk
        In EXAMPLE, clearly note that x32 syscalls are >= X32_SYSCALL_BIT

shutdown.2
    Carsten Grohmann
        SEE ALSO: add close(2)

syscall.2
    Adam Borowski
        Add riscv

wait.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Robin Kuzmin]
        wait() and waitpid() block the calling thread (not process)

wait4.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Martin Mares]
        Soften the warning against the use of wait3()/wait4()
            These functions are nonstandard, but there is no replacement.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199215

crypt.3
encrypt.3
    Carlos O'Donell  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Add notes about _XOPEN_CRYPT
            The distribution may choose not to support _XOPEN_CRYPT in the
            case that the distribution has transitioned from glibc crypt to
            libxcrypt.

fseek.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Andy Owen]
        ERRORS: EBADF should be ESPIPE
    Michael Kerrisk
        Improve EPIPE error text

getcwd.3
    Carlos O'Donell
        Mention that "(unreachable)" is no longer returned for glibc >= 2.27.

makedev.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since glibc 2.28, <sys/types.h> no longer defines these macros

pthread_create.3
    Frederic Brault
        Note default thread stack size for several architectures

tsearch.3
    Jann Horn
        Clarify items vs nodes
            The manpage claimed that tsearch() returns a pointer to a data
            item. This is incorrect; tsearch() returns a pointer to the
            corresponding tree node, which can also be interpreted as a
            pointer to a pointer to the data item.

            Since this API is quite unintuitive, also add a clarifying
            sentence.
    Jann Horn
        tdelete() can return dangling pointers
            POSIX says that deleting the root node must cause tdelete() to
            return some unspecified non-NULL pointer. Glibc implements it by
            returning a dangling pointer to the (freed) root node.
            Therefore, explicitly note that tdelete() may return bad pointers
            that must not be accessed.

elf.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add patchelf(1)

filesystems.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add an entry for tmpfs(5)

group.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add vigr(8)

passwd.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add vipw(8)

sysfs.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add brief note on /sys/fs/smackfs

tmpfs.5
    Mike Frysinger
        Document current mount options
            Some of this content is moved from the mount(8) man page.
            Style was based on proc(5) sections.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove reference to mount(8) for discussion of mount options
            The mount options are now described in this page.
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add Documentation/vm/transhuge.txt
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reformat 'huge' and 'mpol' mount option values as lists
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe 'mpol' mount options
            Based on text from Documentation/filesystems/tmpfs.txt.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document 'huge' mount options
            Based on text from Documentation/vm/transhuge.txt.
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add set_mempolicy(2)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document mpol=local mount option

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove redundant mention of PTRACE_SECCOMP_GET_FILTER

cgroups.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        cgroup.events transitions generate POLLERR as well as POLLPRI

mount_namespaces.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note another case where shared "peer groups" are formed

namespaces.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Konstantin Khlebnikov]
        Mention that device ID should also be checked when comparing NS symlinks
            When comparing two namespaces symlinks to see if they refer to
            the same namespace, both the inode number and the device ID
            should be compared. This point was already made clear in
            ioctl_ns(2), but was missing from this page.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note an idiosyncrasy of /proc/[pid]/ns/pid_for_children
            /proc/[pid]/ns/pid_for_children has a value only after first
            child is created in PID namespace. Verified by experiment.

network_namespaces.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Network namespaces isolate the UNIX domain abstract socket namespace
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add cross reference to unix(7)
            For further information on UNIX domain abstract sockets.

posixoptions.7
    Carlos O'Donell
        Expand XSI Options groups
            We define in detail the X/Open System Interfaces i.e. _XOPEN_UNIX
            and all of the X/Open System Interfaces (XSI) Options Groups.

            The XSI options groups include encryption, realtime, advanced
            realtime, realtime threads, advanced realtime threads, tracing,
            streams, and legacy interfaces.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Use a more consistent, less cluttered layout for option lists
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make function lists more consistent and less cluttered
            Use more consistent layout for lists of functions, and
            remove punctuation from the lists to make them less cluttered.

socket.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Tomi Salminen]
        Fix error in SO_INCOMING_CPU code snippet
            The last argument is passed by value, not reference.

time.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Enrique Garcia]
        Mention clock_gettime()/clock_settime() rather than [gs]ettimeofday()
            gettimeofday() is declared obsolete by POSIX. Mention instead
            the modern APIs for working with the realtime clock.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199049

unix.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rusty Russell]
        ERRORS: add EBADF for sending closed file descriptor with SCM_RIGHTS

vdso.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        VDSO symbols (system calls) are not visible to seccomp(2) filters

xattr.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add selinux(8)

ld.so.8
    Mike Frysinger
        Make lack of separator escaping explicit
            Make it clear that the delimiters in LD_PRELOAD, LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
            and LD_AUDIT cannot be escaped so people don't try various methods
            (such as \:) to workaround it.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove unneeded mention of PATH in discussion of LD_LIBRARY_PATH
            This brief sentence doesn't add value to the text.

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

s390_guarded_storage.2
    Eugene Syromyatnikov
        New page documenting s390_guarded_storage(2) s390-specific system call

address_families.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Eugene Syromyatnikov]
        New page that contains details of socket address families
            There is too much detail in socket(2). Move most of it into
            a new page instead.

bpf-helpers.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Daniel Borkmann, Quentin Monnet]
        Add new man page for eBPF helper functions
            (autogenerated from kernel source files)


Removed Pages
-------------

mdoc.7
mdoc.samples.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Ingo Schwarze]
        Remove mdoc(7) and mdoc.samples(7)
            groff_mdoc(7) from the groff project provides a better
            equivalent of mdoc.samples(7) and the 'mandoc' project
            provides a better mdoc(7). And nowadays, there are virtually
            no pages in "man-pages" that use mdoc markup.


Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

fanotify_init.2
fanotify.7
    nixiaoming  [Amir Goldstein, Michael Kerrisk]
        Document FAN_REPORT_TID
            fanotify_init.2: add new flag FAN_REPORT_TID
            fanotify.7: update description of member pid in
                struct fanotify_event_metadata
    Amir Goldstein
        Document FAN_MARK_FILESYSTEM
            Monitor fanotify events on the entire filesystem.
    Matthew Bobrowski  [Amir Goldstein]
        Document FAN_OPEN_EXEC and FAN_OPEN_EXEC_PERM

io_submit.2
    Adam Manzanares
        Document IOCB_FLAG_IOPRIO

msgctl.2
semctl.2
shmctl.2
    Davidlohr Bueso  [Joe Lawrence, Michael Kerrisk]

prctl.2
    Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Document PR_SET_SPECULATION_CTRL and PR_GET_SPECULATION_CTRL

sched_setattr.2
    Claudio Scordino  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Document SCHED_FLAG_DL_OVERRUN and SCHED_FLAG_RECLAIM

socket.2
    Tobias Klauser
        Document AF_XDP
            Document AF_XDP added in Linux 4.18.

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix some imprecisions in discussion of namespaced file capabilities
            The file UID does not come into play when creating a v3
            security.capability extended attribute.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that v3 security.attributes are transparently created/retrieved
    Michael Kerrisk
        Improve the discussion of when file capabilities are ignored
            The text stated that the execve() capability transitions are not
            performed for the same reasons that setuid and setgid mode bits
            may be ignored (as described in execve(2)). But, that's not quite
            correct: rather, the file capability sets are treated as empty
            for the purpose of the capability transition calculations.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework bounding set as per-thread set in transformation rules
    Michael Kerrisk
        Substantially rework "Capabilities and execution of programs by root"
            Rework for improved clarity, and also to include missing details
            on the case where (1) the binary that is being executed has
            capabilities attached and (2) the real user ID of the process is
            not 0 (root) and (3) the effective user ID of the process is 0
            (root).
    Marcus Gelderie
        Add details about SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS
            The description of SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS is misleading about the
            effects on the effective capabilities of a process during a
            switch to nonzero UIDs.  The effective set is cleared based on
            the effective UID switching to a nonzero value, even if
            SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS is set. However, with this bit set, the
            effective and permitted sets are not cleared if the real and
            saved set-user-ID are set to nonzero values.
    Marcus Gelderie
        Mention header for SECBIT constants
            Mention that the named constants (SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS and others)
            are available only if the linux/securebits.h user-space header
            is included.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add text introducing bounding set along with other capability sets
    Michael Kerrisk  [Allison Randal]
        Update URL for location of POSIX.1e draft standard
    Michael Kerrisk
        CAP_SYS_CHROOT allows use of setns() to change the mount namespace
    Michael Kerrisk  [Pierre Chifflier]
        Ambient capabilities do not trigger secure-execution mode
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add a subsection on per-user-namespace "set-user-ID-root" programs
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework discussion of exec and UID 0, correcting a couple of details
            Clarify the "Capabilities and execution of programs by root"
            section, and correct a couple of details:
            * If a process with rUID == 0 && eUID != 0 does an exec,
              the process will nevertheless gain effective capabilities
              if the file effective bit is set.
            * Set-UID-root programs only confer a full set of capabilities
              if the binary does not also have attached capabilities.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update URL for libcap tarballs
            The previous location does not seem to be getting updated.
            (For example, at the time of this commit, libcap-2.26
            had been out for two months, but was not present at
            http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/security/linux-privs.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify which capability sets capset(2) and capget(2) apply to
            capset(2) and capget(2) apply operate only on the permitted,
            effective, and inheritable process capability sets.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Correct the description of SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add background details on capability transformations during execve(2)
            Add background details on ambient and bounding set when
            discussing capability transformations during execve(2).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document the 'no_file_caps' kernel command-line option

cgroup_namespaces.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Troy Engel]
        Clarify the example by making an implied detail more explicit.
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=201047

cgroups.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add more detail on v2 'cpu' controller and realtime threads
            Explicitly note the scheduling policies that are relevant for the
            v2 'cpu' controller.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document the use of 'cgroup_no_v1=named' to disable v1 named hierarchies
            This feature was added in Linux 5.0.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mike Weilgart]
        Complete partial sentence re kernel boot options and 'nsdelegate'
            https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=201029
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reframe the text on delegation to include more details about cgroups v1
    Michael Kerrisk  [Leah Hanson]
        Rework discussion of writing to cgroup.type file
            In particular, it is possible to write "threaded" to a
            cgroup.type file if the current type is "domain threaded".
            Previously, the text had implied that this was not possible.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Balbir Singh, Marcus Gelderie]
        Soften the discussion about delegation in cgroups v1
            Balbir pointed out that v1 delegation was not an accidental
            feature.

epoll.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Introduce the terms "interest list" and "ready list"
    Michael Kerrisk
        Consistently use the term "interest list" rather than "epoll set"
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reformat Q&A list
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that edge-triggered notification wakes up only one waiter
            Note a useful performance benefit of EPOLLET: ensuring that
            only one of multiple waiters (in epoll_wait()) is woken
            up when a file descriptor becomes ready.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Expand the discussion of the implications of file descriptor duplication
            In particular, note that it may be difficult for an application
            to know about the existence of duplicate file descriptors.

feature_test_macros.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Andreas Westfeld]
        Add more detail on why FTMs must be defined before including any header

inotify.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Paul Millar]
        Note ENOTDIR error that can occur for IN_ONLYDIR
            Note ENOTDIR error that occurs when requesting a watch on a
            nondirectory with IN_ONLYDIR.

ip.7
    Bert Hubert
        IP_RECVTTL error fixed
            I need to get the TTL of UDP datagrams from userspace, so I set
            the IP_RECVTTL socket option.  And as promised by ip.7, I then get
            IP_TTL messages from recvfrom.  However, unlike what the manpage
            promises, the TTL field gets passed as a 32 bit integer.

man.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: remove mdoc.samples(7)

mount_namespaces.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add findmnt(8)

namespaces.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        List factors that may pin a namespace into existence
            Various factors may pin a namespace into existence, even when it
            has no member processes.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Tycho Kirchner]
        Briefly explain why CAP_SYS_ADMIN is needed to create nonuser namespaces
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention ioctl(2) in discussion of namespaces APIs
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add pam_namespace(8)

pid_namespaces.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify the semantics for the adoption of orphaned processes
            Because of setns() semantics, the parent of a process may reside
            in the outer PID namespace. If that parent terminates, then the
            child is adopted by the "init" in the outer PID namespace (rather
            than the "init" of the PID namespace of the child).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note a detail of /proc/PID/ns/pid_for_children behavior
            After clone(CLONE_NEWPID), /proc/PID/ns/pid_for_children is empty
            until the first child is created. Verified by experiment.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that a process can do unshare(CLONE_NEWPID) only once

sched.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Eugene Syromyatnikov]
        In the kernel source SCHED_OTHER is actually called SCHED_NORMAL
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add ps(1) and top(1)
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add chcpu(1), lscpu(1)

signal.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Robin Kuzmin]
        Clarify that sigsuspend() and pause() suspend the calling *thread*
    Helge Deller
        Add signal numbers for parisc
    Michael Kerrisk
        Unify signal lists into a signal table that embeds standards info
            Having the signals listed in three different tables reduces
            readability, and would require more table splits if future
            standards specify other signals.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reorder the architectures in the signal number lists
            x86 and ARM are the most common architectures, but currently
            are in the second subfield in the signal number lists.
            Instead, swap that info with subfield 1, so the most
            common architectures are first in the list.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Place signal numbers in a separate table
            The current tables of signal information are unwieldy,
            as they try to cram in too much information.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Insert standards info into tables
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add clone(2)

socket.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer reader to unix(7) for information on SO_PASSSEC
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add address_families(7)

socket.7
unix.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move text describing SO_PEERCRED from socket(7) to unix(7)
            This is, AFAIK, an option specific to UNIX domain sockets, so
            place it in unix(7).

tcp.7
udp.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add a reference to socket(7) noting existence of further socket options

unix.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Enhance the description of SCM_RIGHTS
            The existing description is rather thin. More can be said.
    Michael Kerrisk
        There is a limit on the size of the file descriptor array for SCM_RIGHTS
            The limit is defined in the kernel as SCM_MAX_FD (253).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework SO_PEERCRED text for greater clarity
    Michael Kerrisk  [Felipe Gasper]
        Clarify SO_PASSCRED behavior
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explicitly note that SO_PASSCRED provides SCM_CREDENTIALS messages
    Michael Kerrisk
        If the buffer to receive SCM_RIGHTS FDs is too small, FDs are closed
    Michael Kerrisk
        One must send at least one byte of real data with ancillary data
    Michael Kerrisk
        Ancillary data forms a barrier when receiving on a stream socket
    Michael Kerrisk
        When sending ancillary data, only one item of each type may be sent
    Michael Kerrisk
        Improve wording describing socket option argument/return values
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify treatment of incoming ancillary data if 'msg_control' is NULL
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note behavior if buffer to receive ancillary data is too small
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix a minor imprecision in description of SCM_CREDENTIALS
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer reader to socket(7) for information about SO_PEEK_OFF

user_namespaces.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework terminology describing ownership of nonuser namespaces
            Prefer the word "owns" rather than "associated with" when
            describing the relationship between user namespaces and non-user
            namespaces. The existing text used a mix of the two terms, with
            "associated with" being predominant, but to my ear, describing the
            relationship as "ownership" is more comprehensible.

vdso.7
    Helge Deller
        Fix parisc gateway page description

ld.so.8
    Michael Kerrisk  [Florian Weimer, David Newall]
        Document the --preload command-line option added in glibc 2.30

Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

tsearch.3
    Florian Weimer  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Document the twalk_r() function added in glibc 2.30


New and changed links
---------------------

twalk_r.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        New link to twalk(3) page


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

accept.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that 'addrlen' is left unchanged in the event of an error
            See http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=836.

bpf.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update kernel version info for JIT compiler

clone.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jakub Nowak]
        CLONE_CHILD_SETTID has effect before clone() returns *in the child*
            CLONE_CHILD_SETTID may not have had effect by the time clone()
            returns in the parent, which could be relevant if the
            CLONE_VM flag is employed. The relevant kernel code is in
            schedule_tail(), which is called in ret_from_fork()
            in the child.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=203105

execve.2
exec.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Dr. Jürgen Sauermann]
        Consistently use the term 'pathname' (not 'path')

execve.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that stack+environ size is also limited to 3/4 of _STK_LIM
            In fs/exec.c::prepare_arg_pages(), we have:

                    limit = _STK_LIM / 4 * 3;
                    limit = min(limit, bprm->rlim_stack.rlim_cur / 4);
    Michael Kerrisk  [Dr. Jürgen Sauermann]
        SEE ALSO: refer to exec(3) (rather than execl(3))

pipe.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that 'pipefd' is left unchanged in the event of an error
            See http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=467.

sched_setaffinity.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Brice Goglin]
        Correct details of return value of sched_getaffinity() syscall

setfsgid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite for improved clarity and defer to setfsuid() for details
            Rewrite for improved clarity and defer to setfsuid(2) for the
            rationale of the fsGID rather than repeating the same details
            in this page.

setfsuid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite for improved clarity and to hint history more explicitly
            The current text reads somewhat clumsily. Rewrite it to introduce
            the eUID and fsUID in parallel, and more clearly hint at the
            historical rationale for the fsUID, which is detailed lower in
            the page.

socketpair.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that 'sv' is left unchanged in the event of an error
            See also http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=483.

splice.2
    Slavomir Kaslev
        EAGAIN can occur when called on nonblocking file descriptors

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Andreas Korb]
        Remove crufty text about i386 syscall dispatch table
            The removed text long ago ceased to be accurate. Nowadays, the
            dispatch table is autogenerated when building the kernel (via
            the kernel makefile, arch/x86/entry/syscalls/Makefile).

tee.2
    Slavomir Kaslev
        EAGAIN can occur when called on nonblocking file descriptors

fopen.3
    Elliot Hughes
        Explain BSD vs glibc "a+" difference
            Where is the initial read position for an "a+" stream?

            POSIX leaves this unspecified. Most BSD man pages are silent, and
            MacOS has the ambiguous "The stream is positioned at the end of
            the file", not differentiating between reads and writes other than
            to say that fseek(3) does not affect writes. glibc's documentation
            explicitly specifies that the initial read position is the
            beginning of the file.

mallinfo.3
    Elliott Hughes
        Further discourage use of mallinfo()
            The BUGS section already explains why you need to be cautious
            about using mallinfo, but given the number of bug reports we see
            on Android, it seems not many people are reading that far. Call it
            out up front.

malloc_trim.3
    Carlos O'Donell
        Update trimming information
            Since glibc 2.8, commit 68631c8eb92, the malloc_trim function has
            iterated over all arenas and free'd back to the OS all page runs
            that were free.  This allows an application to call malloc_trim to
            consolidate fragmented chunks and free back any pages it can to
            potentially reduce RSS usage.

posix_memalign.3
    Elliot Hughes
        Some functions set errno
            True of bionic, glibc, and musl. (I didn't check elsewhere.)

resolver.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Wladimir Mutel]
        Mention that some functions set 'h_errno'

stdarg.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Vincent Lefevre]
        Remove the NOTES section describing the ancient varargs macros
            stdarg.h is now 30 years old, and gcc long ago (2004) ceased to
            implement <varargs.h>. There seems little value in keeping this
            text.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=202907
    Michael Kerrisk  [Egmont Koblinger]
        Add a note that "..." in function signature means a variadic function
            Egmont suggested adding this, because the string "..." appears
            at several other points in the page, but just to indicate that
            some text is omitted from example code.

strerror.3
    Jakub Wilk
        Don't discuss buffer size for strerror_l()
            Unlike strerror_r(), strerror_l() doesn't take buffer length as an
            argument.

strtol.3
strtoul.3
    Jakub Wilk
        SEE ALSO: add strtoimax(3), strtoumax(3)

sysconf.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Hugues Evrard]
        Clearly note that _SC_PAGESIZE and _SC_PAGE_SIZE are synonyms

tsearch.3
    Florian Weimer
        Do not use const arguments in twalk() callback
            The const specifier is not part of the prototype (it only applies
            to the implementation), so showing it here confuses the reader.
    Michael Kerrisk
        SYNOPSIS: add missing definition of 'VISIT' type
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reformat twalk() and twalk_r() prototypes for easier readability

console_codes.4
    Jakub Wilk
        Document that \e[1;n] and \e[2;n] support 16 colors
            Source: setterm_command() in drivers/tty/vt/vt.c

elf.5
    Michael Kerrisk  [Keegan Saunders]
        A data segment does not have PF_X

proc.5
    Michael Witten  [Anisse Astier]
        Add missing Inode field to /proc/net/unix

hostname.7
    Florian Weimer
        HOSTALIASES/search path processing is DNS-specific
            Other NSS modules do not necessarily honor these settings.

inode.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that timestamp fields measure time starting at the Epoch
    Michael Kerrisk
        Timestamp fields are structures that include a nanosecond component
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add references to execve(2) to describe set-UID/set-GID behaviors

    Tobias Klauser  [Palmer Dabbelt]
        Document vDSO for RISCV

Renamed pages
-------------

sysvipc.7
    svipc(7) is renamed to sysvipc(7).
        The name sysvipc is a bit more natural, and is the name used in
        /proc/sysvipc.

New and changed links
---------------------

svipc.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add old name of sysvipc(7) page as a link


Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change reference to svipc(7) to sysvipc(7)


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

pldd.1
    G. Branden Robinson  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Document glibc's unbreakage of tool
            After a longstanding breakage, pldd now works again (glibc 2.30).

bpf.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Correct kernel version for JIT support on s390

chdir.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add ENOTDIR error for fchdir()

execve.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Eugene Syromyatnikov]
        Since Linux 5.1, the limit on the #! line is 255 chars (rather than 127)
    Shawn Landden  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Add more detail about Shebangs
    Michael Kerrisk
        Linux is not alone in ignoring the set-UID and set-GID bits for scripts

mount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: Add a couple of EINVAL errors for MS_MOVE
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add chroot(2) and pivot_root(2)

mprotect.2
    Mark Wielaard
        pkey_mprotect() acts like mprotect() if pkey is set to -1, not 0

mprotect.2
pkey_alloc.2
    Mark Wielaard  [Florian Weimer]
        _GNU_SOURCE is required for the pkey functions.

pivot_root.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: EINVAL occurs if 'new_root' or its parent has shared propagation
    Michael Kerrisk
        'new_root' must be a mount point
            It appears that 'new_root' may not have needed to be a mount
            point on ancient kernels, but already in Linux 2.4.5 this changed.
    Michael Kerrisk
        'put_old' can't be a mount point with MS_SHARED propagation
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add mount(2)

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Alan Stern]
        Note that poll() equivalent code for ppoll() is not quite equivalent

prctl.2
    Yang Xu  [Cyrill Gorcunov]
        Correct some details for PR_SET_TIMERSLACK

setxattr.2
    Finn O'Leary  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Add ERANGE to 'ERRORS' section

tkill.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        glibc 2.30 provides a wrapper for tgkill()

dlopen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify the rules for symbol resolution in a dlopen'ed object
            The existing text wrongly implied that symbol look up first
            occurred in the object and then in main, and did not mention
            whether dependencies of main where used for symbol resolution.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify when an executable's symbols can be used for symbol resolution
            The --export-dynamic linker option is not the only way that main's
            global symbols may end up in the dynamic symbol table and thus be
            used to satisfy symbol reference in a shared object. A symbol
            may also be placed into the dynamic symbol table if ld(1)
            notices a dependency in another object during the static link.
    Michael Kerrisk
        An object opened with RTLD_LOCAL can be promoted to RTLD_GLOBAL
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that symbol use might keep a dlclose'd object in memory
    Michael Kerrisk
        On dlclose(), destructors are called when reference count falls to 0
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make it clear that RTLD_NODELETE also affects global variables
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that constructors are called only when library is first loaded

exec.3
    Matthew Kenigsberg
        Explain function groupings
            I've found the exec man page quite difficult to read when trying
            to find the behavior for a specific function. Since the names of
            the functions are inline and the order of the descriptions isn't
            clear, it's hard to find which paragraphs apply to each function.
            I thought it would be much easier to read if the grouping based on
            letters is stated.

getutent.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Thorsten Glaser]
        Fix missing include file in EXAMPLE
            See https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=932382

on_exit.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Sami Kerola]
        Stack variables may be out of scope when exit handler is invoked

strcat.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Eric Sanchis]
        Fix off-by-one error in example code

cpuid.4
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add cpuid(1)

elf.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add ld.so(8)

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Correct description of /proc/PID/status 'ShdPnd' and 'SigPnd' fields
            These fields are signal masks, not counters.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that various mask fields in /proc/PID/status are in hexadecimal

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add a note about using strace on binaries that have capabilities
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add pivot_root(2) to CAP_SYS_ADMIN list
    Michael Kerrisk
        CAP_FOWNER also allows modifying user xattrs on sticky directories

cgroup_namespaces.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Some wording fixes to improve clarity
    Michael Kerrisk
        In the example shell session, give second shell a different prompt

credentials.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that /proc/PID/status shows a process's credentials
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add tcgetsid(3)

fanotify.7
    Matthew Bobrowski
        Reword FAN_REPORT_FID data structure inclusion semantics
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify logic in ESTALE check
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reorder text in EXAMPLE
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reformat program output to fit in 80 columns

mount_namespaces.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify implications for other NS if mount point is removed in one NS
            If a mount point is deleted or renamed or removed in one mount
            namespace, this will cause an object that is mounted at that
            location in another mount namespace to be unmounted (as verified
            by experiment). This was implied by the existing text, but it is
            better to make this detail explicit.
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add pivot_root(2), pivot_root(8)

namespaces.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note initial values of hostname and domainname in a new UTS namespace

sched.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add pthread_getschedparam(3)

signal.7
    Michal Sekletar  [Oleg Nesterov, Michael Kerrisk]
        Clarify that siginfo_t isn't changed on coalescing
    Michael Kerrisk
        Various fields in /proc/PID/status show signal-related information
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add subsection on queuing and delivery semantics for standard signals

socket.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        select()/poll()/epoll honor SO_RCVLOWAT since Linux 2.6.28

unix.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note SCM_RIGHTS interaction with RLIMIT_NOFILE
            If the file descriptors received in SCM_RIGHTS would cause
            the process to its exceed RLIMIT_NOFILE limit, the excess
            FDs are discarded.

user_namespaces.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe the effect of file-related capabilities inside user namespaces
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe how kernel treats UIDs/GIDs when a process accesses files

vdso.7
    Tobias Klauser
        Mention removal of Blackfin port in Linux 4.17

ld.so.8
    Michael Kerrisk  [Matthias Hertel]
        Note some further details of secure-execution mode
            Note some further details of the treatment of environment
            variables in secure execution mode. In particular (as noted by
            Matthias Hertel), note that ignored environment variables are also
            stripped from the environment. Furthermore, there are some other
            variables, not used by the dynamic linker itself, that are also
            treated in this way (see the glibc source file
            sysdeps/generic/unsecvars.h).

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

pidfd_open.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Christian Brauner, Florian Weimer, Daniel Colascione]
        New page documenting pidfd_open(2)

pidfd_send_signal.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Florian Weimer, Christian Brauner]
        New page documenting pidfd_send_signal(2)

pivot_root.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Eric W. Biederman, Reid Priedhorsky, Philipp Wendler]
        This page has been completely rewritten, adding a lot of missing
        details (including the use of pivot_root(".", ".")) and an example
        program.  In addition, the text prevaricating on whether or not
        pivot_root() might change the root and current working directories has
        been eliminated, and replaced with a simple description of the behavior
        of the system call, which has not changed for 19 years, and will not
        change in the future.  Many longstanding errors in the old version of
        the page have also been corrected.

ipc_namespaces.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        New page with content migrated from namespaces(7)

uts_namespaces.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        New page with content migrated from namespaces(7)


Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

clone.2
    Christian Brauner, Michael Kerrisk
        Document CLONE_PIDFD
            Add an entry for CLONE_PIDFD. This flag is available starting
            with kernel 5.2. If specified, a process file descriptor
            ("pidfd") referring to the child process will be returned in
            the ptid argument.

fanotify_mark.2
    Jakub Wilk
        Document FAN_MOVE_SELF

ptrace.2
    Dmitry V. Levin  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Document PTRACE_GET_SYSCALL_INFO

regex.3
    Rob Landley
        Document REG_STARTEND


New and changed links
---------------------

res_nclose.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add NEW link to resolver.3


Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: correct list order

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove section number from references to function in its own page

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: correct alphabetical order


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

localedef.1
    Marko Myllynen
        Describe recently added options
            Describe few recently added options (present in glibc-2.29).

clone.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add pidfd_open(2)

copy_file_range.2
    Amir Goldstein  [Dave Chinner]
        Kernel v5.3 updates

fanotify_mark.2
    Jakub Wilk
        Add kernel version numbers for some FAN_* constants

getdomainname.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add mention of UTS namespaces

gethostname.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jakub Wilk]
        Mention UTS namespaces

io_submit.2
    Matti Moell  [Matti Möll]
        Fix kernel version numbers for 'aio_rw_flags' flags

kill.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add pidfd_send_signal(2)

mmap.2
    Nikola Forró
        Fix EINVAL conditions
            Since introduction of MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE, in case flags contain
            both MAP_PRIVATE and MAP_SHARED, mmap() doesn't fail with EINVAL,
            it succeeds.

            The reason for that is that MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE is in fact equal
            to MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_SHARED.

mount.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Reid Priedhorsky]
        Describe the concept of "parent mounts"
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: add subsection heading for /proc/[pid]/{mounts,mountinfo}
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework the text on mount namespaces a little
            Eliminate the term "Per-process namespaces" and add a reference
            to mount_namespaces(7).

move_pages.2
    Yang Xu  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Mark E2BIG as deprecated
            E2BIG was removed in 2.6.29, we should mark it as deprecated.

perf_event_open.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Alexey Budankov]
        SEE ALSO: add Documentation/admin-guide/perf-security.rst

prctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that PR_GET_SPECULATION_CTRL returns value as function result
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that PR_MCE_KILL_GET returns value via function result
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that PR_GET_FP_MODE returns value as function result
    Michael Kerrisk
        RETURN VALUE: add some missing entries
            Note success return for PR_GET_SPECULATION_CTRL and PR_GET_FP_MODE.

rt_sigqueueinfo.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that 'si_code' can't be specified as SI_KERNEL
    Michael Kerrisk
        The rules for 'si_code' don't apply when sending a signal to oneself
            The restriction on what values may be specified in 'si_code'
            apply only when sending a signal to a process other than the
            caller itself.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rename 'uinfo' argument to 'info'
            This is more consistent with the naming in other pages
            that refer to a 'siginfo_t' structure.
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add pidfd_send_signal(2)

sched_setaffinity.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        RETURN VALUE: sched_getaffinity() syscall differs from the wrapper

setns.2
    Mike Frysinger
        Fix CLONE_NEWNS restriction info

sigaction.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add pidfd_send_signal(2)

signalfd.2
    Andrew Clayton, Michael Kerrisk
        Note about interactions with epoll & fork

statx.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Simone Piccardi]
        Clarify details of a case where an invalid 'mask' value may be rejected

syscall.2
    Shawn Anastasio
        Add information for powerpc64
    Michael Kerrisk  [Adam Borowski, Florin Blanaru]
        Update name of syscall instruction for riscv

syscalls.2

Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

clone.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Christian Brauner, Jakub Wilk]
        Document clone3()

wait.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add P_PIDFD for waiting on a child referred to by a PID file descriptor

bpf-helpers.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refresh against kernel v5.4-rc7


New and changed links
---------------------

clone3.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        New link to clone(2)


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

clone.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rename arguments for consistency with clone3()
            Make the names of the clone() arguments the same as the fields
            in the clone3() 'args' struct:

                ctid        ==> child_pid
                ptid        ==> parent_tid
                newtls      ==> tld
                child_stack ==> stack
    Michael Kerrisk
        Consistently order paragraphs for CLONE_NEW* flags
            Sometimes the descriptions of these flags mentioned the
            corresponding section 7 namespace manual page and then the
            required capabilities, and sometimes the order was the was
            the reverse. Make it consistent.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Christian Brauner, Jann Horn]
        EXAMPLE: Allocate child's stack using mmap(2) rather than malloc(3)
            Christian Brauner suggested mmap(MAP_STACK), rather than
            malloc(), as the canonical way of allocating a stack for the
            child of clone(), and Jann Horn noted some reasons why
            (MAP_STACK exists elsewhere, and mmap() returns a page-aligned
            block of memory, which is useful if we want to set up a guard
            page at the end of the stack).
    Michael Kerrisk  [Christian Brauner]
        Tidy up the description of CLONE_DETACHED
            The obsolete CLONE_DETACHED flag has never been properly
            documented, but now the discussion CLONE_PIDFD also requires
            mention of CLONE_DETACHED. So, properly document CLONE_DETACHED,
            and mention its interactions with CLONE_PIDFD.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Christian Brauner]
        Give the introductory paragraph a new coat of paint
            Change the text in the introductory paragraph (which was written
            20 years ago) to reflect the fact that clone*() does more things
            nowadays.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove wording that suggests CLONE_NEW* flags are for containers
            These flags are used for implementing many other interesting
            things by now.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove various details that are already covered in namespaces pages
            Remove details of UTS, IPC, and network namespaces that are
            already covered in the corresponding namespaces pages in section 7.

clone.2
proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Adjust references to namespaces(7)
            Adjust references to namespaces(7) to be references to pages
            describing specific namespace types.

fallocate.2
    Andrew Price
        Add gfs2 to the list of punch hole-capable filesystems

ioctl_iflags.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Robert Edmonds]
        Emphasize that FS_IOC_GETFLAGS and FS_IOC_SETFLAGS argument is 'int *'

ioctl_list.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add reference to ioctl(2) SEE ALSO section
            The referenced section lists various pages that document ioctls.

mmap.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that MAP_STACK exists on some other systems
    Michael Kerrisk
        Some rewording of the description of MAP_STACK
            Reword a little to allow for the fact that there are now
            *two* reasons to consider using this flag.

pidfd_open.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note the waitid() use case for PID file descriptors
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add a subsection header "Use cases for PID file descriptors"
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make it a little more explicit the CLONE_PIDFD returns a PID FD

pivot_root.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        EXAMPLE: allocate stack using mmap() MAP_STACK rather than malloc()

quotactl.2
    Yang Xu  [Jan Kara]
        Add some details about Q_QUOTAON

seccomp.2
cgroups.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Switch to "considerate language"

select.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        POLLIN_SET/POLLOUT_SET/POLLEX_SET are now defined in terms of EPOLL*
            Since kernel commit a9a08845e9acbd224e4ee466f5c1275ed50054e8, the
            equivalence between select() and poll()/epoll is defined in terms
            of the EPOLL* constants, rather than the POLL* constants.

wait.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        waitid() can be used to wait on children in same process group as caller
            Since Linux 5.4, idtype == P_PGID && id == 0 can be used to wait
            on children in same process group as caller.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify semantics of waitpid(0, ...)
            As noted in kernel commit 821cc7b0b205c0df64cce59aacc330af251fa8f7,
            threads create an ambiguity: what if the calling process's PGID
            is changed by another thread while waitpid(0, ...) is blocked?
            So, clarify that waitpid(0, ...) means wait for children whose
            PGID matches the caller's PGID at the time of the call to
            waitpid().

getauxval.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Witold Baryluk]
        Clarify that AT_BASE_PLATFORM and AT_EXECFN return pointers to strings
            See https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=942207

resolv.conf.5
    Florian Weimer
        Attempt clarify domain/search interaction
            The domain directive is historic at this point; it should not
            be used.

netdevice.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Silviu Popescu]
        Small wording fix in description of SIOCGIFCONF
            SIOCGIFCONF returns "network layer" addresses (not "transport
            layer").

uts_namespaces.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add a little more detail on scope of UTS namespaces

    Michael Kerrisk
        Document CLONE_CLEAR_SIGHAND

fcntl.2

        Update manpage with new memfd F_SEAL_FUTURE_WRITE seal

memfd_create.2
    Joel Fernandes
        Update manpage with new memfd F_SEAL_FUTURE_WRITE seal

        Document LOOP_SET_BLOCK_SIZE
    Yang Xu
        Document LOOP_SET_DIRECT_IO

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document /proc/sys/vm/unprivileged_userfaultfd


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

capget.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Yang Xu]
        Add missing details in EPERM error for setting inheritable capabilities

clone.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that CLONE_THREAD causes similar behavior to CLONE_PARENT
            The introductory paragraphs note that "the calling process" is
            normally synonymous with the "the parent process", except in the
            case of CLONE_PARENT. The same is also true of CLONE_THREAD.
    Christian Brauner  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Mention that CLONE_PARENT is off-limits for inits
    Michael Kerrisk  [Colin Ian King]
        Add old EINVAL error for AArch64
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: add EINVAL for use of CLONE_PARENT by an init process

futex.2
    Ponnuvel Palaniyappan
        Fix a bug in the example

listen.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Peter Gajdos]
        The 'somaxconn' default value has increased to 4096

modify_ldt.2
set_thread_area.2
    Andy Lutomirski  [Markus T Metzger]
        Fix type of base_addr

move_pages.2
    John Hubbard  [Michal Hocko]
        Remove ENOENT from the list of possible return values

open.2
    Adam Borowski
        No need for /proc to make an O_TMPFILE file permanent
            In the example snippet, we already have the fd, thus there's no
            need to refer to the file by name.  And, /proc/ might be not
            mounted or not accessible.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Joseph C. Sible]
        In O_TMPFILE example, describe alternative linkat() call
            This was already shown in an earlier version of the page,
            but Adam Borowski's patch replaced it with an alternative.
            Probably, it is better to show both possibilities.

perf_event_open.2
    Daniel Colascione
        Mention EINTR for perf_event_open

ptrace.2
    Denys Vlasenko
        PTRACE_EVENT_STOP does not always report SIGTRAP

quotactl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Don't show numeric values of Q_XQUOTAON XFS_QUOTA_?DQ_* flags
            The programmer should not need to care about the numeric values,
            and their inclusion is verbosity.
    Yang Xu  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Add EINVAL error of Q_XQUOTARM operation

stime.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that stime() is deprecated

syscall.2
    Petr Vorel  [Cyril Hrubis]
        Update feature test macro requirements

sysctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        This system call was removed in Linux 5.5; adjust the page accordingly

userfaultfd.2
    Yang Xu  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Add EPERM error

cmsg.3
    Rich Felker
        Clarify alignment issues and correct method of accessing CMSG_DATA()
            From an email by Rich Felker:

            It came to my attention while reviewing possible breakage with
            move to 64-bit time_t that some applications are dereferencing
            data in socket control messages (particularly SCM_TIMESTAMP*)
            in-place as the message type, rather than memcpy'ing it to
            appropriate storage. This necessarily does not work and is not
            supportable if the message contains data with greater alignment
            requirement than the header. In particular, on 32-bit archs,
            cmsghdr has size 12 and alignment 4, but struct timeval and
            timespec may have alignment requirement 8.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rich Felker]
        Modify CMSG_DATA() example to use memcpy()
            See previous patch to this page for rationale

exit.3
    Benjamin Peterson  [Mike Frysinger]
        Use hex for the status mask

ftime.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that this function is deprecated

getpt.3
    Samuel Thibault
        Remove mention of O_NOCTTY
            The glibc implementation of getpt has actually never been setting

malloc.3
    Vegard Nossum
        Clarify realloc() return value
    Petr Vorel
        Remove duplicate _GNU_SOURCE

console_codes.4
    Adam Borowski
        Document \e[90m to 97, 100 to 107
    Adam Borowski
        \e[21m is now underline
            Since 65d9982d7e523a1a8e7c9af012da0d166f72fc56 (4.17), it follows
            xterm rather than common sense and consistency, being the only
            command 1..9 where N+20 doesn't undo what N did.  As libvte
            0.51.90 got changed the same way, this behaviour will probably
            stay.
    Adam Borowski
        Update \e[38m and \e[48m
            Supported since cec5b2a97a11ade56a701e83044d0a2a984c67b4 (3.16).

cgroups.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        The v2 freezer controller was added in Linux 5.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Split discussion of cgroups.events file and v2 release notification
            In preparation for adding a description of the "frozen" key.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe the cgroup.events "frozen" key
    Michael Kerrisk
        Improve the discussion of the advantages of v2 release notification

inotify.7
    Nick Shipp
        Merge late perror() into fprintf() in example code

netlink.7
    Antonin Décimo
        Fix alignment issue in example

packet.7
    kevin sztern  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Add missing tpacket_auxdata field (tp_vlan_tpid)

rtnetlink.7
    Antonin Décimo
        ifa_index is an unsigned int

tcp.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        tcp_low_latency is ignored since Linux 4.14

unix.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        The PID sent with SCM_CREDENTIALS must match an existing process

vsock.7
    Mikhail Golubev  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Add missing structure element
            The structure 'struct sockaddr_vm' has additional element
            'unsigned char svm_zero[]' since version v3.9-rc1.

ldconfig.8
    DJ Delorie
        Document file filter and symlink pattern expectations

Apologies if I missed anyone!


New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

openat2.2
    Aleksa Sarai  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Document new openat2(2) syscall

pidfd_getfd.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Christian Brauner]
        New manual page documenting the pidfd_getfd() system call

select.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite DESCRIPTION
            Improve structure and readability, at the same time incorporating
            text and details that were formerly in select_tut(2). Also
            move a few details in other parts of the page into DESCRIPTION.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Consolidate the discussion of pselect into a headed subsection
    Michael Kerrisk
        Consolidate historical glibc pselect() details under one subhead
    Michael Kerrisk
        Consolidate info on usleep() emulation in one place
    Michael Kerrisk
        Place the discussion of the self-pipe technique in a headed subsection
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that FD_SET() and FD_CLR() do not return errors
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove details of historical #include requirements
            The POSIX situation has been the norm for a long time now,
            and including ancient details overcomplicates the page.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove some ancient information about pre-POSIX types for 'timeout'

select_tut.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Eliminate duplication of info across select_tut.2 and select2
            There was a lot of a duplication of info in SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION
            RETURN VALUE, and SEE ALSO. Move all of the info to one place:
            the select(2) page.

sysvipc.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite this page as just a summary of the System V IPC APIs
            All of the other details in this page have by now been moved into
            the relevant *ctl(2) pages.

time_namespaces.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Andrei Vagin, Dmitry Safonov, Thomas Gleixner]
        New page documenting time namespaces

    Ricardo Biehl Pasquali, Michael Kerrisk
        Add description of SO_SELECT_ERR_QUEUE
    Alejandro Colomar  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Document SO_TIMESTAMPNS


Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove a few mentions of the ancient "Linux libc"

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global formatting fix: disfavor nonstandard .TP indents
            In many cases, these don't improve readability, and (when stacked)
            they sometimes have the side effect of sometimes forcing text
            to be justified within a narrow column range.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk  [Christian Brauner]
        Fix clumsy wording around "nonnegative file descriptors"


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

clock_getres.2
    Helge Deller  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Consecutive calls for CLOCK_MONOTONIC may return same value
            Consecutive calls to clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC) are guaranteed
            to return MONOTONIC values, which means that they either return
            the *SAME* time value like the last call, or a later (higher) time
            value.
    Eric Rannaud
        Dynamic POSIX clock devices can return other errors
    Michael Kerrisk
        Improve description of CPU-time clocks
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add an example program
    Michael Kerrisk
        CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE is not settable
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that CPU-time clocks are not settable.
            Explicitly note that CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID and
            CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID are not settable.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that CLOCK_TAI is nonsettable
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that CLOCK_MONOTONIC is system-wide
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: add EINVAL for attempt to set a nonsettable clock
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move text in BUGS to NOTES
            The fact that CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID and
            CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID are not settable isn't a bug,
            since POSIX does allow the possibility that these clocks
            are not settable.
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add time_namespaces(7)

clock_nanosleep.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        clock_nanosleep() can also sleep against CLOCK_TAI
    Michael Kerrisk
        clock_nanosleep() also supports CLOCK_BOOTTIME
            Presumably (and from a quick glance at the source code)
            since Linux 2.6.39, when CLOCK_BOOTTIME was introduced.

clock_nanosleep.2
timer_create.2
timerfd_create.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add various missing errors
            Mostly verified by testing and reading the code.

            There is unfortunately quite a bit of inconsistency across API~s:

                              clock_gettime  clock_settime  clock_nanosleep  timer_create  timerfd_create

            CLOCK_TAI                 y        n (EINVAL)     y                y             n (EINVAL)

            CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID   y        n (EINVAL)     n (EINVAL [2])   y             n (EINVAL)
            pthread_getcpuclockid()   y        n (EINVAL)     y                y             n (EINVAL)

            [1] The caller must have CAP_WAKE_ALARM, or the error EPERM results.

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

ioctl_fslabel.2
    Eric Sandeen
        New page documenting filesystem get/set label ioctl(2) operations


Removed pages
-------------

ioctl_list.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Heinrich Schuchardt, Eugene Syromyatnikov]
        This page was first added more than 20 years ago. Since
        that time it has seen hardly any update, and is by now
        very much out of date, as reported by Heinrich Schuchardt
        and confirmed by Eugene Syromyatnikov.

        As Heinrich says:

            Man-pages like netdevices.7 or ioctl_fat.2 are what is
            needed to help a user who does not want to read through the
            kernel code.

            If ioctl_list.2 has not been reasonably maintained since
            Linux 1.3.27 and hence is not a reliable source of
            information, shouldn't it be dropped?

        My answer is, yes (but let's move a little info into ioctl(2)).

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Retitle EXAMPLE section heading to EXAMPLES
            EXAMPLES appears to be the wider majority usage across various
            projects' manual pages, and is also what is used in the POSIX
            manual pages.

Various pages

        Remove AVAILABILITY section heading
            In the few pages where this heading (which is "nonstandard" within
            man-pages) is used, it always immediately follows CONFORMING TO
            and generally contains information related to standards. Remove
            the section heading, thus incorporating AVAILABILITY into

Various "aio" pages
    Michael Kerrisk  [Andi Kleen, Jeff Moyer]
        Change uses of aio_context_t to io_context_t


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

bpf.2
    Peter Wu
        Update enum bpf_map_type and enum bpf_prog_type
    Richard Palethorpe
        Change note on unprivileged access
            The kernel now allows calls to bpf() without CAP_SYS_ADMIN
            under some circumstances.

clone.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add kernel version numbers for clone_args fields
    Michael Kerrisk
        Combine separate NOTES sections

close.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Lukas Czerner, Peter Schiffer, Thierry Lelegard]
        Note behavior when close() happens in a parallel thread
            If one thread is blocked in an I/O system call on a file descriptor
            that is closed in another thread, then the blocking system call
            does not return immediately, but rather when the I/O operation
            completes. This surprises some people, but is longstanding
            behavior.

connect.2
    Stefan Puiu
        Can return EACCES because of SELinux

execve.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Eric Hopper]
        Changes to the "dumpable" flag may change ownership of /proc/PID files

fanotify_init.2
    Amir Goldstein  [Matthew Bobrowski]
        Move out of place entry FAN_REPORT_FID
            It was inserted in the middle of the FAN_CLASS_ multi flags bit
            and broke the multi flag documentation.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Alexander Morozov, Amir Goldstein, Jan Kara]
        Remove mention of FAN_Q_OVERFLOW as an input value in 'mask'
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=198569.
    Amir Goldstein  [Jan Kara, Matthew Bobrowski]
        Clarification about FAN_EVENT_ON_CHILD and new events
    Amir Goldstein  [Jan Kara, Matthew Bobrowski]
        Clarification about FAN_MARK_MOUNT and FAN_REPORT_FID

mbind.2
    Li Xinhai  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Remove note about MPOL_MF_STRICT been ignored

mmap.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Heinrich Schuchardt]
        Don't mark MAP_ANON as deprecated

move_pages.2
    Yang Shi  [Michal Hocko]
        Returning positive value is a new error case

mremap.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove mention of "Segmentation fault" in EFAULT text
            "Segmentation fault" (SIGSEGV) is not exactly the same thing as
            EFAULT.

        Reorder some paragraphs in NOTES
    Michael Kerrisk

    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add nfsd(7)

open.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Some '*at' APIs have functionality that isn't in conventional APIs
            Note that another reason to use the *at() APIs is to access
            'flags' functionality that is not available in the corresponding
            conventional APIs.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add a few more APIs to list in "Rationale for openat()..."

    Dave Martin
        Sort prctls into alphabetical order
    Dave Martin
        Clarify that prctl can apply to threads
            The current synopsis for prctl(2) misleadingly claims that prctl
            operates on a process.  Rather, some (in fact, most) prctls operate
    Dave Martin  [Dave Hansen]
        Document removal of Intel MPX prctls

dlsym.3
    Alexander Monakov
        Extend discussion of NULL symbol values
            Avoid implying that use of IFUNC is the only way to produce a
            symbol with NULL value. Give more scenarios how a symbol may get
            NULL value, but explain that in those scenarios dlsym() will fail
            with Glibc's ld.so due to an implementation inconsistency.

err.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        EXAMPLES: use EXIT_FAILURE rather than 1 as exit status

Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

prctl.2
    Dave Martin
        Add SVE prctls (arm64)
            Add documentation for the PR_SVE_SET_VL and PR_SVE_GET_VL
            prctls added in Linux 4.15 for arm64.
    Dave Martin  [Catalin Marinas]
        Add tagged address ABI control prctls (arm64)
            Add documentation for the PR_SET_TAGGED_ADDR_CTRL and

setns.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document the use of PID file descriptors with setns()
            Starting with Linux 5.8, setns() can take a PID file descriptor as
            an argument, and move the caller into or more of the namespaces of
            the thread referred to by that descriptor.

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document CAP_BPF
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add CAP_PERFMON

symlink.7
    Aleksa Sarai
        Document magic links more completely


Global changes
--------------

A few pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Use \` rather than `
            \` produces better rendering in PDF.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk  [Geoff Clare]
        Use "\(ti" instead of "~"
            A naked tilde ("~") renders poorly in PDF. Instead use "\(ti",
            which renders better in a PDF, and produces the same glyph
            when rendering on a terminal.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk  [Geoff Clare]
        Use "\(ha" rather than "^" in code
            This renders better in PDF.

Various pages
    Mike Frysinger
        Drop "coding: UTF-8" header
            This header is used inconsistently -- man pages are UTF-8 encoded
            but not setting this marker.  It's only respected by the man-db
            package, and seems a bit anachronistic at this point when UTF-8
            is the standard default nowadays.

Various pages
    Mike Frysinger
        Trim leading blank comment line
            Very few pages do this, so trim them.

Various pages
    Mike Frysinger
        Use standard .\" comment style
            The \" comment produces blank lines.  Use the .\" that the vast
            majority of the codebase uses instead.

Various pages
    Mike Frysinger  [G. Branden Robinson]
        Various pages: Drop t comment header
            Historically, a comment of the following form at the top of a
            manual page was used to indicate too man(1) that the use of tbl(1)
            was required in order to process tables:

                '\" t

            However, at least as far back as 2001 (according to Branden),
            man-db's man(1) automatically uses tbl(1) as needed, rendering
            this comment unnecessary. And indeed many existing pages in
            man-pages that have tables don't have this comment at the top of
            the file.  So, drop the comment from those files where it is
            present.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

ioctl_tty.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix a confusing wording error in description of TIOCSPTLCK

iopl.2
    Thomas Piekarski  [victorm007@yahoo.com]
        Updating description of permissions and disabling interrupts
            Update description of permissions for port-mapped I/O set
            per-thread and not per-process. Mention that iopl() can not
            disable interrupts since Linux 5.5 anymore and is in general
            deprecated and only provided for legacy X servers.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=205317

keyctl.2
    Oleksandr Kravchuk
        Declare auth_key to fix a compilation error in example code

lseek.2
    Andrew Price
        List gfs2 support for SEEK_HOLE/SEEK_DATA

mount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: add EINVAL for bind mount of mount namespace inode

open.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Say a bit more about what happens when 'mode' is wrongly omitted

pidfd_open.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add the setns(2) use case for PID file descriptors
    Michael Kerrisk
        Close the pidfd in EXAMPLE
            Close the PID file descriptor in the example program, to hint to
            the reader that like every other kind of file descriptor, a PID FD
            should be closed.

prctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        The parent death signal is cleared on some credential changes
            See kernel/cred.c::commit_creds() in the Linux 5.6 source code.

seccomp.2
    Andy Lutomirski
        Improve x32 and nr truncation notes

send.2
recv.2
    Alyssa Ross
        Add msg_iovlen POSIX note
            msg_iovlen is incorrectly typed (according to POSIX) in addition
            to msg_controllen, but unlike msg_controllen, this wasn't
            mentioned for msg_iovlen.

setns.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        EXAMPLE: use O_CLOEXEC when opening namespace file descriptor
    Michael Kerrisk
        It is possible to setns() to the caller's current PID namespace
            The page currently incorrectly says that 'fd' must refer to
            a descendant PID namespace. However, 'fd' can also refer to
            the caller's current PID namespace. Verified by experiment,
            and also comments in kernel/pid_namespace.c (Linux 5.8-rc1).

sync.2
    Jeff Layton
        syncfs() now returns errors if writeback fails
            A patch has been merged for v5.8 that changes how syncfs() reports
            errors. Change the sync() manpage accordingly.

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add faccessat2(), added in Linux 5.8

sysctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        glibc removed support for sysctl() starting in version 2.32

atoi.3
    Arkadiusz Drabczyk
        Explain disadvantages of atoi()
    Michael Kerrisk
        Relocate BUGS section
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add NOTES section explaining 0 return value on error
            And note that this is not specified by POSIX.

fread.3
    Arkadiusz Drabczyk
        Add example
    Arkadiusz Drabczyk
        Explain that file position is moved after calling fread()/fwrite()
            Corresponding manpage on FreeBSD already contains that
            information.

getpt.3
posix_openpt.3
pts.4
    Michael Kerrisk
        Use the term "pseudoterminal multiplexor device" for /dev/ptmx
            Let's use some consistent terminology for this device.

posix_memalign.3
    Bruno Haible
        Clarify how to free the result of posix_memalign

pthread_rwlockattr_setkind_np.3
    Carlos O'Donell  [Kumar Kartikeya Dwivedi]
        Clarify a PTHREAD_RWLOCK_PREFER_WRITER_NP detail

queue.3
    Alejandro Colomar
        Remove wrong code from example
    Alejandro Colomar
        Comment out text for functions not in glibc (related: 6559169cac)

pts.4
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove NOTES on BSD pseudoterminals
            This information is already covered better in pty(7). No need to
            mention it again here.

hosts.5
    Thomas Bartelsmeier
        Clarify capability for IPv6 outside of examples
            Resolves https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=208279

proc.5
    Jakub Wilk
        Use "pwd -P" for printing cwd
            "/bin/pwd" happens to work with the GNU coreutils implementation,
            which has -P as the default, contrary to POSIX requirements.

            Use "pwd -P" instead, which is shorter, easier to type, and should
            work everywhere.
    Arkadiusz Drabczyk
        Inform that comm in /proc/pid/{stat,status} might also be truncated
            pgrep for example searches for a process name in /proc/pid/status

resolv.conf.5
    Michael Kerrisk  [Helge Kreutzmann]
        Clarify that ip6-bytestring was removed in 2.25

capabilities.7
    Dan Kenigsberg
        Clarify that CAP_SYS_NICE relates to *lowering* the nice value
    Saikiran Madugula
        CAP_SYS_RESOURCE: add two more items for POSIX message queues
            CAP_SYS_RESOURCE also allows overriding /proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msg_max
            and /proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msgsize_max.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Dan Kenigsberg]
        Clarify wording around increasing process nice value
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add getpcaps(8)

cgroups.7
cpuset.7
    Sven Hoexter
        Update kernel cgroup documentation references
            cgroups-v1/v2 documentation got moved to the "admin-guide" subfolder
            and converted from .txt files to .rst

ip.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Stephen Hemminger]
        Remove mention of ipfw(4) which was in long obsolete ipchains project

man-pages.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some notes on generating optimal glyphs
            Getting nice renderings of ^ ` and ~ requires special
            steps in the page source.

pty.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explicitly mention CONFIG_LEGACY_PTYS
            Explicitly mention CONFIG_LEGACY_PTYS, and note that it is disabled
            by default since Linux 2.6.30.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Relocate a paragraph to NOTES

standards.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add an entry for POSIX.1-1988
    Michael Kerrisk  [Geoff Clare]
        Correct various details in the explanation of XPG/POSIX/SUS

ld.so.8
    Florian Weimer  [Michael Kerrisk]
        List more places in which dynamic string tokens are expanded
            This happens for more than just DT_RPATH/DT_RUNPATH.
    Arkadiusz Drabczyk
        Explain that empty entry in LD_LIBRARY_PATH means cwd

zic.8
    Michael Kerrisk
        Sync to 2020a tzdb release
            From https://www.iana.org/time-zones, version 2020a.

            Add a page documenting the pthread_attr_setsigmask_np(3) and
            pthread_attr_getsigmask_np(3) functions added in glibc 2.32.

queue.7
    Alejandro Colomar
        Create summary page for 'queue' APIs
            The former queue(3) page was rather unwieldy, as it attempted to
            describe too many APIs. After splitting that content out into a
            number of smaller pages ( circleq.3, list.3, slist.3, stailq.3,
            and tailq.3) move the much-reduced queue(3) page, which is now
            essentially a summary of those APIs, from Section 3 to Section 7.

Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Alejandro Colomar
            Use ``sizeof`` consistently through all the examples in the
            following way:

            - Use the name of the variable instead of its type as argument for
              ``sizeof``.

Various pages
    Alejandro Colomar
        Use sizeof() to get buffer size (instead of hardcoding macro name)

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Use \(aq instead of ' inside monospace fonts
            Use \(aq to get an unslanted single quote inside monospace code
            blocks. Using a simple ' results in a slanted quote inside PDFs.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk, Alejandro Colomar
        Use C99 style to declare loop counter variables
            Rather than:

                sometype x;

                for (x = ....; ...)

            use

                for (sometype x = ...; ...)

            This brings the declaration and use closer together (thus aiding
            readability) and also clearly indicates the scope of the loop
            counter variable.

        Switch printf() casts to use [u]intmax_t + %ju / %jd
            Let's move to the 21st century. Instead of casting system data
            types to long/long long/etc. in printf() calls, instead cast to
            intmax_t or uintmax_t, the largest available signed/unsigned
            integer types.

Various pages
    Alejandro Colomar
        Omit 'int' keyword for 'short', 'long' and 'long long' types

Various pages
    Alejandro Colomar
        Remove unneeded casts

    Alejandro Colomar
        In printf(): s/0x%/%#/ except when followed by X instead of x
            Use printf()'s '#' flag character to prepend the string "0x".

            However, when the number is printed in uppercase, and the prefix
            is in lowercase, the string "0x" needs to be manually written.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Use C99-style declarations for readability
            Rather than writing things such as:

                struct sometype *x;
                ...
                x = malloc(sizeof(*x));

            let's use C99 style so that the type info is in the same line as
            the allocation:

                struct sometype *x = malloc(sizeof(*x));

Various pages
    Alejandro Colomar
        Cast to 'unsigned long' rather than 'long' when printing with "%lx"

stdarg.3
    Alejandro Colomar
        Declare variables with different types in different lines
        In particular, don's mix a variable and a pointer declaration
        on the same line: TYPE x, *p;


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

memusage.1
    Michael Kerrisk
        EXAMPLES: remove doubled calculations
            The same calculations are repeated in malloc() and printf() calls.
            For better readability, do the calculations once.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Use %zu rather than %zd when printing 'size_t' values

clock_getres.2
    Alejandro Colomar
        EXAMPLES: use 'const' when appropriate
    Alejandro Colomar  [Jakub Wilk]
        Cast 'time_t' to 'int' for printf() and fix the length modifiers
    Michael Kerrisk  [Tony May]
        Fix type and variable name in dynamic clock code example

        CAP_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE can now be used to employ 'set_tid'

epoll_ctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        epoll instances can be nested to a maximum depth of 5
            This limit appears to be an off-by-one count against
            EP_MAX_NESTS (4).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move some version info from CONFORMING TO to VERSIONS

eventfd.2

        ERRORS: add EBUSY

openat.2
    Alejandro Colomar
        SYNOPSIS: return long
            The Linux kernel uses long as the return type for this syscall.
            As glibc provides no wrapper, use the same type the kernel uses.

open_by_handle_at.2
    Alejandro Colomar
        Use "%u" rather than "%d" when printing 'unsigned int' values

    Michael Kerrisk  [Jann Horn]
        Warn reader that SECCOMP_RET_TRACE can be overridden
            Highlight to the reader that if another filter returns a
            higher-precedence action value, then the ptracer will not
            be notified.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rich Felker]
        Warn against the use of SECCOMP_RET_KILL_THREAD
            Killing a thread with SECCOMP_RET_KILL_THREAD is very likely
            to leave the rest of the process in a broken state.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rich Felker]
        EXAMPLES: use SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS rather than SECCOMP_RET_KILL
    Alejandro Colomar
        Use ARRAY_SIZE() macro instead of raw sizeof division

setns.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Correct the version for time namespace support

sigaction.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Alejandro Colomar]
        Use correct POSIX type for siginfo_t.si_value

    Michael Kerrisk
        Move system calls from discontinued ports out of main syscall list
            Various ports that had their own indigenous system calls have
            been discontinued. Remove those system calls (none of which had
            manual pages!) to a separate part of the page, to avoid
            cluttering the main list of system calls.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add close_range (Linux 5.9)

dlopen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify DT_RUNPATH/DT_RPATH details
            It is the DT_RUNPATH/DT_RPATH of the calling object (not the
            executable) that is relevant for the library search. Verified
            by experiment.

errno.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Alejandro Colomar]
        Note that the pthreads APIs do not set errno

        Fix return value for underflow

strtol.3
    Alejandro Colomar
        EXAMPLES: simplify errno checking
    Alejandro Colomar
        EXAMPLES: as the default base, use special value 0

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Under CAP_SYS_ADMIN, group "sub-capabilities" together
            CAP_BPF, CAP_PERFMON, and CAP_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE have all been
            added to split out the power of CAP_SYS_ADMIN into weaker pieces.
            Group all of these capabilities together in the list under
            CAP_SYS_ADMIN, to make it clear that there is a pattern to these
            capabilities.
    Michael Kerrisk
        CAP_SYS_ADMIN implies CAP_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE
            But the latter, weaker capability is preferred.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add kernel doc reference for CAP_PERFMON

fanotify.7

        Explicitly note that pthreads APIs return an errno-style value on error

rtld-audit.7
    Florian Weimer  [Carlos O'Donell]
        Clarify la_version handshake
            Returning its argument without further checks is almost always
            wrong for la_version.
    Alejandro Colomar
        Use "%u" rather than "%d" when printing 'unsigned int' values

sigevent.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that 'sigev_notify_thread_id' is Linux-specific
