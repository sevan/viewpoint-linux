.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR atoi ()
function converts the initial portion of the string
pointed to by \fInptr\fP to
.IR int .
The behavior is the same as
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
strtol(nptr, NULL, 10);
.EE
.in
.PP
except that
.BR atoi ()
does not detect errors.
.PP
The
.BR atol ()
and
.BR atoll ()
functions behave the same as
.BR atoi (),
except that they convert the initial portion of the
string to their return type of \fIlong\fP or \fIlong long\fP.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The converted value or 0 on error.

.SH CONFORMING TO
POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, C99, SVr4, 4.3BSD.
C89 and
POSIX.1-1996 include the functions
.BR atoi ()
and
.BR atol ()
only.
.\" .SH NOTES
.\" Linux libc provided
.\" .BR atoq ()
.\" as an obsolete name for
.\" .BR atoll ();
.\" .BR atoq ()
.\" is not provided by glibc.
.\" The
.\" .BR atoll ()
.\" function is present in glibc 2 since version 2.0.2, but
.\" not in libc4 or libc5.
.SH NOTES
POSIX.1 leaves the return value of
.BR atoi ()
on error unspecified.
On glibc, musl libc, and uClibc, 0 is returned on error.
.SH BUGS
.I errno
is not set on error so there is no way to distinguish between 0 as an
error and as the converted value.
No checks for overflow or underflow are done.
Only base-10 input can be converted.
It is recommended to instead use the
.BR strtol ()
and
.BR strtoul ()
family of functions in new programs.

.BR strtod (3),
