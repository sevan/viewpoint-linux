.TH IOCTL_FSLABEL 2 2020-04-20 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
ioctl_fslabel \- get or set a filesystem label
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/ioctl.h>
.br
.B #include <linux/fs.h>
.PP
.BI "int ioctl(int " fd ", FS_IOC_GETFSLABEL, char " label [FSLABEL_MAX]);
.br
.BI "int ioctl(int " fd ", FS_IOC_SETFSLABEL, char " label [FSLABEL_MAX]);
.SH DESCRIPTION
If a filesystem supports online label manipulation, these
.BR ioctl (2)
operations can be used to get or set the filesystem label for the filesystem
on which
.B fd
resides.
The
.B FS_IOC_SETFSLABEL
operation requires privilege
.RB ( CAP_SYS_ADMIN ).
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success zero is returned.  On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
Error can include (but are not limited to) the following:
.TP
.B EFAULT
.I label
references an inaccessible memory area.
.TP
.B EINVAL
The specified label exceeds the maximum label length for the filesystem.
.TP
.B ENOTTY
This can appear if the filesystem does not support online label manipulation.
.TP
.B EPERM
The calling process does not have sufficient permissions to set the label.
.SH VERSIONS
These
.BR ioctl (2)
operations first appeared in Linux 4.18.
They were previously known as
.B BTRFS_IOC_GET_FSLABEL
and
.B BTRFS_IOC_SET_FSLABEL
and were private to Btrfs.
.SH CONFORMING TO
This API is Linux-specific.
.SH NOTES
The maximum string length for this interface is
.BR FSLABEL_MAX ,
including the terminating null byte (\(aq\\0\(aq).
Filesystems have differing maximum label lengths, which may or
may not include the terminating null.  The string provided to
.B FS_IOC_SETFSLABEL
must always be null-terminated, and the string returned by
.B FS_IOC_GETFSLABEL
will always be null-terminated.
